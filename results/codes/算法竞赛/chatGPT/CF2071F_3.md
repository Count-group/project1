Wrong answer on test 1

# For each candidate p, we want to check whether we can choose a subsequence of length Lreq = n - k that is p‐towering.
# In a p‐towering subsequence b[0..Lreq-1] there is an index r (the “peak”) such that for every j,
#     b[j] >= p - abs(r - j).
# One valid choice is to “force” the peak to be at some position and then “greedily” choose as many elements as possible
# on the left (by processing the left segment in its natural order with the reversed threshold) and on the right.
# Here we precompute for the given p two arrays:
#   L[i] = maximum length obtainable from a[0..i] by greedily selecting elements with rule:
#          maintain a counter cnt (starting at 0) and for each element, if a[i] >= p - (cnt+1) then cnt++.
#   R[i] = maximum length obtainable from a[i..n-1] (scanned forward) by the same rule.
# Then for each index i with a[i] >= p (a valid peak candidate), if
#       (L[i-1] if i > 0 else 0) + 1 + (R[i+1] if i < n-1 else 0) >= Lreq,
# we can form a p‐towering subsequence.
#
# This check runs in O(n) for each p. We then binary search for the maximum p in [1, max(a)].
# Note: the greedy rule uses “p - (cnt+1)” as the current threshold.
