// 
// Explanation of the approach:
// 
// We interpret the process as follows. There are n residents (floors 1..n). When a resident on floor i throws a paper airplane,
// all residents on floors i..n see it. A resident will throw an airplane only if, from their perspective (i.e. the throws by residents
// on floors i..n that have already occurred), strictly fewer than c airplanes have been seen.
// Also, by day’s end every resident must have seen at least c throws.
// One can show that the top‐floor resident (floor n) must throw exactly c times.
// For any resident i (with i < n) who does throw (i.e. X throws where X > 0) the order condition forces that
// in the merged order of throws by resident i and those on higher floors, the i–resident’s throws occur in the first c positions.
// This gives a factor of C(c-1, X-1) if resident i throws X times (and if a resident never throws, we set X = 0).
//
// In our record some throws are fixed. Let fixedCount[i] be the number of throws recorded for resident i.
// In any valid completed record the total throws by resident i, call it X[i], must satisfy X[i] ≥ fixedCount[i].
// Moreover, since a resident who does throw may throw at most c times (by the dynamic rule), for i < n we require X[i] is either 0 or 1 ≤ X[i] ≤ c,
// while for resident n we must have X[n] = c.
// Also, the overall total throws is m, so 
//      (X[1] + ... + X[n]) = m.
// Denote by free (or freeCount) the number of throws with lost info. They equal m minus the total fixed throws.
// When assigning free throws we “add” to each resident i an extra amount d[i] = X[i] - fixedCount[i] (for those who throw, d[i] > 0).
// The free throws appear in arbitrary order; their placement gives a multinomial factor: freeCount! divided by ∏ d[i]!.
// 
// We sum over all valid distributions { X[1], …, X[n] } (with X[n] fixed to c) that satisfy
//      ∑ (X[i]) = m   and   X[i] ≥ fixedCount[i] (and for i < n, X[i] is either 0 or between 1 and c).
// For a resident i (1 ≤ i < n):
//   - If X[i] = 0 then no order factor is needed (and it is only allowed if fixedCount[i] == 0).
//   - If X[i] > 0, the valid order factor is C(c-1, X[i]-1).
// For resident n, we must have X[n] = c; its order factor is C(c-1, c-1)=1.
// 
// Let S = m - c = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} X[i].
// Let R = freeCount = m - (sum_{i=1}^{n} fixedCount[i]) and note that resident n will “use” (c - fixedCount[n]) free throws,
// so for residents 1..(n-1) the free throws allocated sum must be R' = freeCount - (c - fixedCount[n]).
// 
// We use DP over residents 1..(n-1). For resident i, we try all valid X (0 or from 1 to c with X ≥ fixedCount[i]).
// For each such X, the extra free throws allocated is d = (X > 0 ? X - fixedCount[i] : 0).
// The contribution factor for resident i is defined as:
//      cost(i, X) = 0 if X < fixedCount[i].
//      cost(i, 0) = 1 (this option is allowed only if fixedCount[i] == 0).
//      For X > 0: cost(i, X) = C(c-1, X-1) * invfact[ d ]
// (We will later multiply by fact[freeCount] to account for the multinomial coefficient.)
//
// Then we want to sum over residents 1..(n-1) with total extra free throws allocated = R' and total X-sum = S.
// We use a DP that only tracks the total free allocation (since S is fixed by m and resident n).
// Finally, we multiply the DP result by the factor for resident n: invfact[c - fixedCount[n]] (since resident n gets exactly (c - fixedCount[n]) free throws)
// and by fact[freeCount].
//
// If any constraint is violated, the answer is 0.
//
