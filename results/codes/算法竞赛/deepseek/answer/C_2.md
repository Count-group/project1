To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of coins required to reconnect a tree after removing a vertex and all its incident edges. The cost of reconnecting the tree is based on the weights of the vertices used to form new edges, which increase each time a vertex is used.

### Approach
1. **Tree Structure Analysis**: When a vertex `u` is removed, the tree splits into several components equal to the degree of `u`. To reconnect these components, we need `k-1` edges where `k` is the degree of `u`.
2. **Optimal Edge Selection**: The goal is to minimize the cost by selecting vertices with the smallest weights. The optimal approach involves using the smallest weights and accounting for their reuse, which increases their cost incrementally.
3. **Global Sorting and Prefix Sums**: Precompute the sorted list of all vertex weights and their prefix sums to efficiently compute sums of the smallest weights excluding the removed vertex.
4. **Handling Multiple Uses**: When the required number of edges exceeds the available vertices, compute the cost considering repeated uses of vertices, which involves additional costs due to incrementing weights.

### Solution Code

import bisect

def main():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    w = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for _ in range(n-1):
        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        edges[u].append(v)
        edges[v].append(u)
    
    # Precompute global sorted list and prefix sums
    sorted_global = sorted(w)
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)

            # Need to handle q and r
            q, r = divmod(m, s)
            # Compute sum_excl = sum of sorted_global excluding u's contribution
            # sum_excl is sum_global - w_u
            sum_excl = sum_global - w_u
            
            # Compute sum_elements = q * sum_excl + sum of first r elements in the new list
            sum_elements = q * sum_excl

            total = sum_elements + sum_choose
            print(total, end=' ')
        else:

### Explanation
1. **Preprocessing**: The global sorted list of vertex weights and their prefix sums are precomputed to efficiently calculate sums of the smallest elements.
2. **Degree Calculation**: The degree of each vertex is determined to understand how many components the tree splits into when that vertex is removed.
3. **Handling Each Vertex**: For each vertex, compute the required number of edges and their costs. If the number of edges exceeds available vertices, handle repeated uses by calculating additional costs due to weight increments.
4. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Using binary search and prefix sums, efficiently compute the sum of the smallest weights required, considering the exclusion of the removed vertex and possible repeated uses.

This approach ensures that the solution efficiently handles large inputs and correctly computes the minimum cost for reconnecting the tree after removing each vertex.
