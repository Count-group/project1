To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid sequences of operations where each step involves XORing one of P, Q, or R with a given array element such that after each step, all three variables P, Q, and R are not pairwise distinct. The solution involves dynamic programming to track valid sequences efficiently.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming States**:
   - **State A**: All three variables (P, Q, R) are equal.
   - **State B**: Exactly two variables are equal, tracked using a dictionary where the key is the XOR value of the third variable.

2. **Transitions**:
   - **For a zero element**:
     - From State A: All three choices (P, Q, R) keep the variables equal, leading to State A.
     - From State B: All three choices keep two variables equal and the third different, leading to State B.
   - **For a non-zero element**:
     - From State A: Any choice transitions to State B with the XOR value of the element.
     - From State B: XORing the third variable transitions to another State B with an updated XOR value. If the element matches the current XOR value of the third variable, XORing one of the equal variables transitions to State B again with the same key but twice the count.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    t = int(input[ptr])
    ptr += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[ptr])
        ptr += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))
        ptr += n
        
        dpA = 1  # Number of ways where P=Q=R
        dpB = defaultdict(int)  # Key: s (third variable), Value: count
        
        for num in a:
            if num == 0:
                # All choices keep or transition to valid states
                newA = (dpA * 3) % MOD
                newB = defaultdict(int)
                for s, cnt in dpB.items():
                    newB[s] = (cnt * 3) % MOD
                dpA, dpB = newA, newB
            else:
                newA = 0  # Non-zero elements cannot transition to State A from B
                newB = defaultdict(int)
                
                # Transition from State A
                if dpA > 0:
                    newB[num] = (newB[num] + dpA * 3) % MOD
                
                # Transition from State B
                for s, cnt in dpB.items():
                    # Assign to third variable
                    new_s = s ^ num
                    newB[new_s] = (newB[new_s] + cnt) % MOD
                    # Assign to one of the two equal variables if possible
                    if s == num:
                        newB[s] = (newB[s] + 2 * cnt) % MOD
                
                dpA, dpB = newA, newB
        
        total = (dpA + sum(dpB.values())) % MOD
        print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **State Management**: The solution uses two states, `dpA` and `dpB`, to track the number of valid sequences where all variables are equal (State A) and where two variables are equal (State B).
- **Transitions**: For each element in the array, transitions between states are computed based on whether the element is zero or non-zero. Special handling for non-zero elements ensures valid transitions from State B to State B when the element matches the XOR value of the third variable.
- **Efficiency**: Using a dictionary to track State B ensures efficient management of possible XOR values and their counts, avoiding unnecessary computations and ensuring linear time complexity relative to the input size.
