To solve this problem, we need to determine the type of a piece of rubbish based on the maximum similarity to previously stored types. The similarity is defined as the number of positions where characters match up to the minimum length of the two strings. If multiple strings have the same maximum similarity, the type is the minimum among those types.

### Approach
The solution involves using a trie data structure to efficiently store and query the strings based on their similarity. Each node in the trie represents a character at a specific position and tracks the minimum type encountered. The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Trie Structure**: Each trie node tracks the minimum type encountered for strings passing through that node.
2. **Insert Operation**: When inserting a string, it is added to the trie for each possible length up to its actual length. This ensures that all prefixes of the string are considered during queries.
3. **Query Operation**: For each query, check all possible string lengths (1 to 5) and compute the similarity by checking the maximum number of consecutive matching characters starting from the first position. The result is determined by the highest similarity and the minimum type among those with the highest similarity.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

class TrieNode:
    __slots__ = ['children', 'min_type']
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.min_type = float('inf')

class Trie:
    def __init__(self, depth):
        self.root = TrieNode()
        self.depth = depth

    def insert(self, s, x):
        node = self.root
        node.min_type = min(node.min_type, x)
        for c in s[:self.depth]:
            if c not in node.children:
                node.children[c] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[c]
            node.min_type = min(node.min_type, x)

    def get_max_similarity_and_type(self, s):
        node = self.root
        current_sim = 0
        min_type = node.min_type
        for i in range(self.depth):
            if i >= len(s):
                break
            c = s[i]
            if c not in node.children:
                break
            node = node.children[c]
            current_sim += 1
            if node.min_type < min_type:
                min_type = node.min_type
        return current_sim, min_type

def main():
    q = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    tries = {i: Trie(i) for i in range(1, 6)}
    for _ in range(q):
        parts = sys.stdin.readline().split()
        if parts[0] == '1':
            s = parts[1]
            x = int(parts[2])
            m = len(s)
            for M in range(1, min(m, 5) + 1):
                tries[M].insert(s[:M], x)
        else:
            s = parts[1]
            L = len(s)
            max_sim = -1
            best_type = float('inf')
            for M in range(1, 6):
                k = min(M, L)
                current_sim, current_type = tries[M].get_max_similarity_and_type(s[:k])
                if current_sim > max_sim or (current_sim == max_sim and current_type < best_type):
                    max_sim = current_sim
                    best_type = current_type
            print(best_type)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Trie Structure**: Each trie node tracks the minimum type encountered. The trie is built for each possible string length (1 to 5).
2. **Insert Operation**: When inserting a string, it is added to all tries corresponding to lengths from 1 up to the string's length. This ensures that all prefixes are considered during queries.
3. **Query Operation**: For each query, check all possible string lengths (1 to 5). For each length, traverse the trie to find the maximum number of consecutive matching characters starting from the first position and track the minimum type. The result is determined by the highest similarity and the minimum type among those with the highest similarity.

This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging the trie structure to quickly compute similarities and track minimal types, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.
