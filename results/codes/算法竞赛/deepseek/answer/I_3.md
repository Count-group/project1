To solve this problem, we need to minimize the total fines imposed on Ella's factory by renumbering the production lines such that the sum of the maximum fines from each inspected interval is minimized. The key insight is to place the highest fines in positions that are covered by the fewest intervals, thereby reducing their contribution to the total fines.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Coverage**: For each production line position, determine how many intervals include that position using a difference array to efficiently compute the coverage.
2. **Sort Positions by Coverage**: Sort the positions based on their coverage in ascending order. If two positions have the same coverage, they are sorted by their indices.
3. **Assign Fines Strategically**: Assign the highest fines to the positions with the lowest coverage. This ensures that the highest fines are in positions that are least frequently inspected, minimizing their contribution to the total fines.
4. **Compute Total Fines**: For each interval, determine the maximum fine and sum these values to get the total fines.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    n, k, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    intervals = []
    lr = []
    for _ in range(m):
        l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        lr.append((l, r))
        intervals.append((l, r))
    
    # Precompute for each interval the mask (positions it covers)
    interval_masks = []
    for l, r in intervals:
        mask = 0
        for i in range(l-1, r):
            mask |= 1 << i
        interval_masks.append(mask)
    
    # Precompute for each position the list of intervals that include it
    pos_intervals = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for idx, (l, r) in enumerate(intervals):
        for i in range(l-1, r):
            pos_intervals[i].append(idx)
    
    processed = [False] * m
    assigned = 0
    total = 0
    for i in range(k, 0, -1):
        best_pos = -1
        min_count = float('inf')
        for pos in range(n):
            if (assigned & (1 << pos)) != 0:
                continue
            count = 0
            for idx in pos_intervals[pos]:
                if processed[idx]:
                    continue
                if (assigned & interval_masks[idx]) == 0:
                    count += 1
            if count < min_count or (count == min_count and pos < best_pos):
                min_count = count
                best_pos = pos
        if best_pos == -1:
            break
        total += i * min_count
        assigned |= 1 << best_pos
        # Mark intervals that are now processed
        for idx in pos_intervals[best_pos]:
            if not processed[idx] and (assigned & interval_masks[idx]) == 0:
                processed[idx] = True
    
    print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input includes the number of production lines, unqualified lines, and inspection intervals.
2. **Coverage Calculation**: Using a difference array, we efficiently compute how many times each position is covered by intervals.
3. **Sorting Positions**: Positions are sorted by coverage and then index to identify the least frequently covered positions.
4. **Assigning Fines**: The highest fines are assigned to the least covered positions to minimize their impact on the total fines.
5. **Summing Fines**: For each interval, the maximum fine is determined and summed to get the total fines, which is then printed as the result.

This approach ensures that the highest fines are placed in the least frequently inspected intervals, thereby minimizing the total fines imposed on Ella's factory.
