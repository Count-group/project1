To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid ways to fill in the gaps in a sequence of airplane launches such that each resident on each floor of a building stops launching airplanes once they perceive that the required number of airplanes have been launched. The solution must ensure that each resident's perspective (number of airplanes seen) meets the constraints both during the sequence and at the end.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: We use a dynamic programming approach with memoization to track the current state of the sequence. The state is represented by the current position in the sequence and the counts of airplanes launched from each floor up to that point.
2. **Constraints Check**: For each step in the sequence, we check if the current resident can validly launch an airplane based on the number of airplanes seen so far from their floor and higher floors. This ensures that each resident stops launching once they have seen enough airplanes.
3. **State Tracking**: The state tracks the number of airplanes launched from each floor, clamped to the minimum required number `c`. This helps in efficiently checking the constraints and reducing the state space.

    t = int(input[ptr])
    ptr += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, c, m = map(int, input[ptr:ptr+3])
        ptr += 3
        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+m]))
        ptr += m

            for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
                suffix[j] = suffix[j+1] + counts[j]
                if suffix[j] > c:
                    suffix[j] = c + 1  # Mark as exceeding
            
            if pos == m:
                for j in range(n):
                    if suffix[j] < c:
                        return 0

                new_counts = tuple(new_counts)
                return dp(pos + 1, *new_counts) % MOD
            else:

### Explanation
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: The function `dp` is defined with memoization to keep track of the number of valid sequences up to the current position. The state includes the current position in the sequence and the counts of airplanes launched from each floor.
2. **State Representation**: The state is represented by a tuple of counts where each count corresponds to the number of airplanes launched from each floor. This helps in efficiently checking constraints and transitioning between states.
3. **Constraints Check**: For each position in the sequence, if the value is fixed, we check if placing that value is valid given the current state. If it's a gap, we try all possible valid values and sum the valid sequences.
4. **Final Check**: After processing all positions, we check if each floor has seen the minimum required number of airplanes. If so, the sequence is valid.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints using dynamic programming and memoization, ensuring that we only explore valid states and transitions, leading to an optimal solution.
