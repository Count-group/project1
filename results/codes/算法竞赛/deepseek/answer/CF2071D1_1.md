To solve this problem, we need to compute the value of an element in an infinite binary sequence at a given position. The sequence is defined such that elements beyond the first `n` terms are derived using a bitwise XOR operation on a subset of previous elements. Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to avoid recalculating values for large indices repeatedly.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Sequence**: The sequence starts with the first `n` elements provided as input. For any position `m > n`, the element at position `m` is the XOR of all elements up to the floor of `m/2`. This can be simplified using properties of XOR and modular arithmetic since we are dealing with binary values (0 and 1).

2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array modulo 2 for the first `n` elements. This helps in quickly determining the cumulative XOR (equivalent to sum modulo 2) for any initial segment of the sequence.

3. **Recursive Calculation with Memoization**: For positions beyond `n`, use a recursive approach with memoization to compute the required values efficiently. This avoids redundant calculations by storing results of subproblems.

4. **Handling Large Values**: Given the potential size of `m` (up to 10^18), we use properties of binary representation and divide the problem into smaller subproblems, each solvable in logarithmic time relative to `m`.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from sys import stdin

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(input[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[idx])
        l = int(input[idx+1])
        r = int(input[idx+2])
        idx +=3
        a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))
        idx +=n
        m = l  # since l == r
        
        # Precompute prefix sums mod 2
        prefix = [0]*(n+1)
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            prefix[i] = (prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]) % 2
        
        if m <= n:
            print(a[m-1])
            continue
        
        k = m // 2
        
        # Compute f(k) using memoization
        memo = {}
        def compute_f(x):
            if x in memo:
                return memo[x]
            if x <= n:
                return prefix[x]
            sum_initial = prefix[n]
            a_start = n + 1
            b_end = x
            sum_part = 0
            if a_start <= b_end:
                # Compute sum_part
                start = a_start
                end = b_end
                if start % 2 == 1:
                    k_start = (start - 1) // 2
                    sum_part += compute_f(k_start)
                if end % 2 == 0:
                    k_end = end // 2
                    sum_part += compute_f(k_end)
                sum_part %= 2
            total = (sum_initial + sum_part) % 2
            memo[x] = total
            return total
        
        res = compute_f(k)
        print(res)
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps in quickly determining the cumulative XOR (sum modulo 2) for any initial segment of the sequence. For example, `prefix[i]` gives the sum of the first `i` elements modulo 2.

2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**: The function `compute_f` calculates the sum of the first `x` elements modulo 2. If `x` is within the initial `n` elements, it directly uses the precomputed prefix array. For larger values, it splits the problem into smaller subproblems, using memoization to store results and avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Efficient Calculation**: By leveraging the properties of XOR and modular arithmetic, the solution efficiently handles large values of `m` using logarithmic time complexity relative to the size of `m`, ensuring it can handle the upper limits of the problem constraints.

This approach ensures that each query is processed in logarithmic time relative to the position `m`, making the solution both efficient and scalable.
