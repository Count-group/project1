To solve this problem, we need to minimize the total fines imposed on Ella's factory by renumbering the production lines such that the sum of the maximum fines from each inspected interval is minimized. The key insight is to place the highest fines in positions that are covered by the fewest intervals, thereby reducing their contribution to the total fines.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Coverage**: For each production line position, determine how many intervals include that position. This is done using a difference array to efficiently compute the coverage for each position.
2. **Sort Positions by Coverage**: Sort the positions based on their coverage in ascending order. If two positions have the same coverage, they are sorted by their indices.
3. **Assign Fines Strategically**: Assign the highest fines (from K down to 1) to the positions with the lowest coverage. This ensures that the highest fines are in positions that are least frequently inspected, minimizing their contribution to the total fines.
4. **Compute Total Fines**: For each interval, determine the maximum fine within that interval and sum these maximum values to get the total fines.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    n, k, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    intervals = []
    d = [0] * (n + 2)  # 1-based to n

    for _ in range(m):
        l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        intervals.append((l, r))
        d[l] += 1
        d[r + 1] -= 1

    # Compute cnt array
    current = 0
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)  # cnt[0] unused
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current += d[i]
        cnt[i] = current

    # Sort positions by cnt ascending, then index ascending
    sorted_positions = sorted(range(1, n + 1), key=lambda x: (cnt[x], x))
    selected = sorted_positions[:k]

    # Create array A
    A = [0] * n
    for idx in range(k):
        pos = selected[idx]
        A[pos - 1] = k - idx  # Assign K, K-1, ..., 1

    # Calculate sum of maxima for all intervals
    sum_total = 0
    for l, r in intervals:
        start = l - 1
        end = r - 1
        current_max = 0
        for i in range(start, end + 1):
            if A[i] > current_max:
                current_max = A[i]
        sum_total += current_max

    print(sum_total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read, including the number of production lines, the number of unqualified lines, and the intervals to be inspected.
2. **Difference Array for Coverage Calculation**: A difference array is used to efficiently compute how many times each position is covered by the intervals.
3. **Sorting Positions**: Positions are sorted based on their coverage to identify the least frequently covered positions.
4. **Assigning Fines**: The highest fines are assigned to the positions with the lowest coverage to minimize their contribution to the total fines.
5. **Summing Maximum Fines**: For each interval, the maximum fine is determined and summed to get the total fines, which is then printed as the result.

This approach ensures that the highest fines are placed in the least frequently inspected intervals, thereby minimizing the total fines imposed on Ella's factory.
