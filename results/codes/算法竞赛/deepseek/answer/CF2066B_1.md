To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of a magical subsequence from a given sequence of non-negative integers. A sequence is considered magical if for every split point, the minimum of the elements before the split is greater than or equal to the minimum excluded value (mex) of the elements after the split.

### Approach
The key insight to solve this problem is to recognize that for a subsequence to be magical, each element in the subsequence must be greater than or equal to the mex of the elements that follow it. We can leverage this insight by processing the array from right to left and maintaining a set to track the presence of elements. This allows us to efficiently compute the mex of the elements encountered so far.

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty set to track the presence of elements and initialize the current mex to 0.
2. **Right-to-Left Processing**: Iterate through the array from right to left. For each element, check if it is greater than or equal to the current mex.
3. **Update Set and Mex**: If the element is not already in the set, add it and update the mex by checking consecutive integers starting from the current mex.
4. **Count Valid Elements**: Keep a count of valid elements that satisfy the condition.

This approach ensures that we efficiently track the mex and validate each element against it, resulting in an optimal solution.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        present = set()
        current_mex = 0
        count = 0
        for x in reversed(a):
            if x >= current_mex:
                if x not in present:
                    present.add(x)
                    while current_mex in present:
                        current_mex += 1
                count += 1
        print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: We start with an empty set `present` and `current_mex` set to 0.
- **Processing Elements**: By iterating from right to left, we ensure that each element is checked against the mex of the elements that follow it (those already processed and added to the set).
- **Updating Mex**: When an element is added to the set, we update the mex by checking consecutive integers starting from 0 until we find the smallest non-present integer.
- **Counting Valid Elements**: Each valid element (those greater than or equal to the current mex) is counted, ensuring we form the longest possible magical subsequence.

This method efficiently computes the maximum length of the magical subsequence in O(n) time per test case, which is optimal for the given constraints.
