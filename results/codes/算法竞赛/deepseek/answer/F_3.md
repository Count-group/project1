To solve this problem, we need to determine the final value of `x` after Alice and Bob play optimally, with Alice aiming to maximize `x` and Bob aiming to minimize it. The game involves a multiset of numbers that are either 0 or powers of 2, and each player takes turns choosing elements and deciding whether to XOR them with `x`.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The game is turn-based, starting with Alice.
   - Each player will choose elements that maximize their advantage, considering the highest bits first.
   - The outcome of each bit (whether it is set to 1 or 0) depends on the number of elements (count) of that bit and the starting player's parity (even or odd).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The starting player for each bit is determined by the parity of the total number of elements processed before that bit, including zeros.
   - Zeros can be used to adjust the starting parity for subsequent bits, affecting the turn order.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Process each bit from the highest to the lowest.
   - For each bit, determine the desired parity based on whether the count of elements is even or odd.
   - Adjust the starting parity using available zeros to optimize the outcome for the current player.
   - Calculate the outcome for each bit and update the total elements processed.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where k is the number of different bit positions. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Solution Code
```python
k, z = map(int, input().split())
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

outcomes = [0] * k
sum_higher = 0

# Process each bit from highest to lowest
for i in reversed(range(k)):
    current_b = b[i]
    # Determine desired parity based on current bit's count
    desired_parity = 1 if (current_b % 2 == 0) else 0
    current_parity_without_zeros = sum_higher % 2
    current_parity = current_parity_without_zeros
    used_zeros = 0
    
    # Use a zero to adjust parity if possible and needed
    if z > 0:
        if current_parity_without_zeros != desired_parity:
            used_zeros = 1
            z -= 1
            current_parity = desired_parity
    
    # Calculate the outcome for this bit
    outcome = (current_b % 2) ^ current_parity
    outcomes[i] = outcome
    
    # Update the sum of processed elements (higher bits + zeros used + current_b)
    sum_higher += used_zeros + current_b

# Convert the outcomes to binary string, reversed for correct order
binary = ''.join(map(str, reversed(outcomes)))
print(binary)
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The input values for `k` (number of bits) and `z` (number of zeros) are read.
   - The list `b` contains the counts of each power of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(k-1)`.

2. **Processing Bits**:
   - Iterate from the highest bit to the lowest, processing each bit in reverse order.
   - For each bit, calculate the desired parity based on whether the count of elements is even or odd.
   - Adjust the starting parity using available zeros to optimize the outcome for the current player.
   - Calculate the outcome for the current bit and update the total elements processed.

3. **Generating Output**:
   - Construct the binary result by iterating through the outcomes list in reverse order, converting the list to a binary string.

This approach ensures that each bit's outcome is determined optimally, considering the strategies of both players and the presence of zeros, leading to the correct final value of `x` in binary form.
