To solve this problem, we need to construct a permutation of nodes in a tree such that a mouse starting at a given node `st` ends up at a specified trap node `en` after traversing all nodes according to the permutation. The mouse moves one step towards the current node in the permutation if it is not already there.

### Approach
1. **Tree Structure and Path Finding**: The tree is a connected graph with no cycles. We need to find the path from `st` to `en` and ensure that the mouse can reach `en` by following the permutation.
2. **Special Case Handling**: 
   - If `st` and `en` are the same, the permutation must start with `en` and then cover all other nodes in a way that the mouse returns to `en` by the end.
   - If `st` and `en` are different, we need to construct the permutation such that the mouse moves towards `en` in such a way that it finally reaches `en` after all steps.
3. **Parent Tracking**: For each node, track its parent when considering `en` as the root. This helps in determining the path from any node back to `en`.
4. **Post-order Traversal**: Construct the permutation using a post-order traversal starting from `st`, ensuring that nodes are processed in an order that allows the mouse to move towards `en`.

### Explanation
1. **Tree Structure Handling**: The tree is represented using adjacency lists. We find the parent of each node considering `en` as the root using BFS.
2. **Path Construction**: For `st` to `en`, we trace the path using the parent array.
3. **Permutation Construction**: 
   - If `st` equals `en`, handle the special case by ensuring the mouse returns to `en` after processing other nodes in post-order traversal of subtrees rooted at `en`'s children in reverse order.
   - For `st` != `en`, construct the permutation by first processing nodes along the path from `st` to `en` in reverse order, followed by `en`, and then other nodes in post-order traversal to ensure the mouse moves towards `en`.

This approach ensures that the mouse's movement through the permutation results in it ending at `en` after all steps.
