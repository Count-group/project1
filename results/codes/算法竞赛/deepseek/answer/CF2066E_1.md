To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it is possible to identify the poisonous barrel through a series of comparisons and pouring operations without touching the poisonous barrel. The key insight is to ensure that we can always create a scenario where the poisonous barrel can be identified by its weight difference compared to the non-poisonous barrels.

### Approach
The solution hinges on two main conditions:
1. **Existence of Duplicate Values**: If there are at least two barrels with the same initial water volume, we can compare them. If their weights are equal, they are non-poisonous, and we can use them to pour water into other barrels. If their weights are different, the heavier one must be the poisonous barrel.
2. **Sum Condition**: The sum of all barrels except the maximum one must be at least as large as the maximum barrel. This ensures that we can redistribute the water from the smaller barrels into the larger ones to create a detectable difference in weight for the poisonous barrel.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    n, q = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])
    ptr +=2
    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))
    ptr +=n
    
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for num in a:
        count[num] +=1
    
    sum_total = sum(a)
    max_val = max(a) if a else 0
    sum_others = sum_total - max_val
    
    def check():
        has_duplicate = any(v >=2 for v in count.values())
        if has_duplicate:
            return "Yes"
        if len(a) <2:
            return "Yes" if len(a) ==1 else "No"
        sum_total = sum(a)
        max_val = max(a)
        sum_others = sum_total - max_val
        return "Yes" if sum_others >= max_val else "No"
    
    initial = check()
    print(initial)
    
    for _ in range(q):
        query = input[ptr]
        x = int(input[ptr+1])
        ptr +=2
        if query == '+':
            a.append(x)
            count[x] +=1
        else:
            a.remove(x)
            count[x] -=1
            if count[x] ==0:
                del count[x]
        res = check()
        print(res)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Existence of Duplicate Values**: The code checks if there are any duplicate values in the barrels. If duplicates exist, we can use them to safely determine the poisonous barrel through comparison.
2. **Sum Condition**: The code checks if the sum of all barrels except the maximum one is at least as large as the maximum barrel. This allows us to redistribute water such that the poisonous barrel's weight (including the poison) can be detected.

By maintaining a count of each barrel's volume and checking the sum condition after each query, we efficiently determine if the poisonous barrel can be identified safely after each operation. This approach ensures that we handle up to 200,000 queries efficiently, adhering to the problem constraints.
