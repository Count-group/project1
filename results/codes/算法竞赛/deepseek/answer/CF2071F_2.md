To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum value of \( p \) such that after removing at most \( k \) elements from the array, the remaining array can be made \( p \)-towering. A \( p \)-towering array has an index \( i \) where every element \( a_j \) in the array satisfies \( a_j \ge p - |i - j| \).

### Approach
The approach involves using binary search to efficiently determine the maximum possible value of \( p \). For each candidate value of \( p \) during the binary search, we check if it's feasible to form a \( p \)-towering array by removing at most \( k \) elements. This check involves:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Arrays**: We compute two arrays, `left` and `right`, where `left[i]` is the maximum number of valid elements ending at index \( i \) from the left, and `right[i]` is the maximum number of valid elements starting at index \( i \) from the right.
2. **Feasibility Check**: For each index \( i \), if the sum of `left[i]` and `right[i]` (subtracting 1 to avoid double counting the element at \( i \)) is at least \( m \) (where \( m = n - k \)), then \( p \) is feasible.

### Solution Code
```python
import bisect

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, data[idx:idx+2])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        m = n - k
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        max_a = max(a)
        low = 1
        high = max_a + n
        answer = 0
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            left = []
            sequence = []
            for i in range(n):
                val = a[i] - i
                target = mid - i
                pos = bisect.bisect_left(sequence, target)
                if pos < len(sequence):
                    sequence[pos] = val
                else:
                    sequence.append(val)
                left_len = len(sequence)
                left.append(left_len)
            
            right = []
            sequence = []
            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
                val = a[i] + i
                target = mid + i
                pos = bisect.bisect_left(sequence, -target)
                if pos < len(sequence):
                    sequence[pos] = -val
                else:
                    sequence.append(-val)
                right_len = len(sequence)
                right.append(right_len)
            right = right[::-1]
            
            found = False
            for i in range(n):
                total = left[i] + right[i] - 1
                if total >= m:
                    found = True
                    break
            
            if found:
                answer = mid
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to determine the maximum possible value of \( p \). The search range is from 1 to the sum of the maximum element in the array and the array's length.
2. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**: 
   - `left[i]` is computed using a greedy algorithm with binary search to track the longest subsequence ending at \( i \) where each element \( a_j \) satisfies \( a_j \ge p - (i - j) \).
   - `right[i]` is similarly computed but tracks the longest subsequence starting at \( i \) where each element \( a_j \) satisfies \( a_j \ge p - (j - i) \).
3. **Feasibility Check**: For each index \( i \), we check if the sum of `left[i]` and `right[i]` (adjusted for double counting) is at least \( m \). If so, \( p \) is feasible.

This approach efficiently checks each candidate \( p \) using dynamic programming and binary search, ensuring that the solution runs in \( O(n \log \text{max_p}) \) per test case, which is feasible for large inputs.
