To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum value of \( p \) such that after removing at most \( k \) elements from the array, the remaining array can be made \( p \)-towering. A \( p \)-towering array has an index \( i \) where every element \( a_j \) in the array satisfies \( a_j \ge p - |i - j| \).

### Approach
1. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to efficiently determine the maximum possible value of \( p \). The binary search will range from 1 to a high value, which is the sum of the maximum element in the array and the array's length.

2. **Feasibility Check**: For each candidate value of \( p \) during the binary search, we need to check if it's feasible to form a \( p \)-towering array by removing at most \( k \) elements. This check involves:
   - Counting the number of elements \( C \) that are greater than or equal to \( p \).
   - Generating intervals for elements that are less than \( p \) and checking if there exists a valid index \( i \) such that the number of intervals covering \( i \) is at most \( k \).

3. **Interval Management**: For each element \( a_j \) less than \( p \), compute the forbidden interval where \( i \) cannot be located. Use a prefix sum array to efficiently count the number of intervals covering each possible index \( i \).

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, data[idx:idx+2])
        idx += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        m = n - k
        max_a = max(a)
        low = 1
        high = max_a + n  # Upper bound for p
        answer = 0
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            C = sum(1 for num in a if num >= mid)
            if C >= m:
                answer = mid
                low = mid + 1
                continue
            intervals = []
            for j in range(n):
                aj = a[j]
                if aj >= mid:
                    continue
                d = mid - aj
                start = j - d + 1
                end = j + d - 1
                intervals.append((start, end))
            
            delta = [0] * (n + 1)
            for s, e in intervals:
                left = max(s, 0)
                right = min(e, n - 1)
                if left > right:
                    continue
                delta[left] += 1
                if right + 1 < n:
                    delta[right + 1] -= 1
            
            current = 0
            found = False
            for i in range(n):
                current += delta[i]
                if current <= k:
                    if (C + (len(intervals) - current)) >= m:
                        found = True
                        break
            if found:
                answer = mid
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Binary Search**: The binary search is used to efficiently determine the maximum \( p \). The search range starts from 1 to a high value, which is determined based on the maximum element in the array and its length.

2. **Feasibility Check**: For each candidate \( p \):
   - **Count Valid Elements**: Calculate the number of elements \( C \) that are greater than or equal to \( p \). If \( C \) is sufficient (i.e., \( C \ge m \)), \( p \) is feasible.
   - **Generate Intervals**: For elements less than \( p \), compute the intervals where the index \( i \) cannot be located. This is done by determining the start and end of the forbidden intervals.
   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to efficiently count the number of intervals covering each index. This helps determine if there exists an index \( i \) that is covered by at most \( k \) intervals, making \( p \) feasible.

3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks each candidate \( p \) using a prefix sum array, ensuring that the solution runs in \( O(n \log \text{max_p}) \) per test case, which is feasible for large inputs.
