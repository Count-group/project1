To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected number of unordered pairs of distinct vertices that become leaves in a forest formed after some vertices fall with given probabilities. The solution involves leveraging linearity of expectation and efficiently computing probabilities using modular arithmetic.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Each vertex has a probability of falling, which affects the structure of the resulting forest.
   - A leaf in the forest is a vertex that remains and has exactly one neighbor remaining.
   - The goal is to compute the expected number of unordered pairs of such leaves.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - Use linearity of expectation to sum the probabilities of each pair of vertices being leaves.
   - For each vertex, compute the probability that it becomes a leaf considering its neighbors.
   - Handle adjacent and non-adjacent pairs separately to account for their different probability contributions.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute the probability of each vertex being a leaf.
   - Calculate the expected number of pairs using these probabilities, adjusting for adjacent pairs which have a different contribution due to their shared edge.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm efficiently computes the required probabilities in linear time relative to the number of vertices and edges, making it suitable for large inputs.

### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Probabilities and their inverses are computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.
- **Adjacency List**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list to efficiently traverse neighbors.
- **Leaf Probability Calculation**: For each vertex, compute the probability of it becoming a leaf considering its neighbors' probabilities.
- **Expected Pairs Calculation**: The expected number of leaf pairs is computed using linearity of expectation, adjusting for adjacent pairs by correcting their contribution.

This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures correctness using modular arithmetic and careful probability adjustments for adjacent pairs.
