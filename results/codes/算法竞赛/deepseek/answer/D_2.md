To solve this problem, we need to transform a given sequence of non-negative integers into an arithmetic sequence with the minimum cost. An arithmetic sequence is defined by a starting element \( a_1 \) and a common difference \( k \). The goal is to determine the minimum cost by potentially replacing some elements, where each replacement has a specified cost.

### Approach
The solution involves two main steps:
1. **Check for the case where \( k = 0 \)**:
   - For \( k = 0 \), all elements in the sequence must be the same. We compute the cost by finding the most frequent element and summing the costs of elements that need to be replaced to match this element.

2. **Check for \( k \) values from 1 to 1000**:
   - For each possible \( k \), compute the potential starting element \( a_1 \) for each position in the sequence. Track the sum of costs for each valid \( a_1 \) and \( k \) combination, and determine the maximum sum of retained elements to minimize the replacement cost.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    
    total_b = sum(b)
    if n == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    max_sum = 0
    # Handle k=0 case
    count = {}
    for ai, bi in zip(a, b):
        if ai in count:
            count[ai] += bi
        else:
            count[ai] = bi
    if count:
        current_max = max(count.values())
        if current_max > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_max
    
    max_k = 1000  # Check k from 1 to 1000
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        current = {}
        for i in range(n):
            a1 = a[i] - i * k  # 0-based i corresponds to position (i+1)
            if a1 >= 0:
                if a1 in current:
                    current[a1] += b[i]
                else:
                    current[a1] = b[i]
        if current:
            current_max = max(current.values())
            if current_max > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_max
    
    print(total_b - max_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input values for the sequence and their respective costs are read.
2. **Handling \( k = 0 \)**: We create a frequency map to count the sum of costs for each unique element in the sequence. The maximum value in this map gives the best cost for \( k = 0 \).
3. **Checking \( k \) from 1 to 1000**: For each \( k \), we compute the potential starting element \( a_1 \) for each position in the sequence. We use a dictionary to accumulate the costs for valid starting elements and track the maximum sum of retained elements.
4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum cost is derived by subtracting the maximum sum of retained elements from the total cost of all elements.

This approach efficiently checks feasible values of \( k \) and leverages frequency maps to optimize the calculation of the minimum replacement cost.
