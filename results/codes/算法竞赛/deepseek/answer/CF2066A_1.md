To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the hidden object is a directed graph (Object A) or a set of points on a coordinate plane (Object B) using at most two queries per test case. The key insight is that Object A can return a shortest path length of 0 if there is no path between two nodes, while Object B always returns a positive Manhattan distance for distinct points.

### Approach
1. **Query Strategy**: We make two queries for each test case. The first query is between two nodes (i, j) and the second query is between the reverse nodes (j, i). 
2. **Response Analysis**: 
   - If either query returns 0, it must be Object A because Object B will never return 0 for distinct points.
   - If both queries return non-zero values, it must be Object B because Manhattan distances are symmetric and will always return positive values.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    t = int(input[ptr])
    ptr += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[ptr])
        ptr +=1
        x = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))
        ptr +=n
        
        # Make two queries (i=1, j=2) and (i=2, j=1)
        # Query 1: 1 and 2
        print("? 1 2")
        sys.stdout.flush()
        res1 = int(input[ptr])
        ptr +=1
        
        # Query 2: 2 and 1
        print("? 2 1")
        sys.stdout.flush()
        res2 = int(input[ptr])
        ptr +=1
        
        if res1 == 0 or res2 == 0:
            print("! A")
        else:
            print("! B")
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
2. **Queries**: For each test case, we query two pairs of nodes (1, 2) and (2, 1). This is based on the insight that the Manhattan distance in Object B is symmetric and non-zero, while Object A can return 0 if there is no path.
3. **Response Handling**: If either query returns 0, we conclude the object is A. Otherwise, we conclude it is B.

This approach efficiently leverages the properties of the two objects to determine the correct answer within the allowed number of queries.
