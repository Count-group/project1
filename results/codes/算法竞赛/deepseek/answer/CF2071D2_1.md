To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of elements in a given range [l, r] of an infinite binary sequence defined by a recurrence relation. The sequence is initially given for the first n elements, and each subsequent element is determined by the XOR of the first half of the previous elements.

### Approach
1. **Precompute Prefix XORs**: Calculate the cumulative XOR (prefix_xor) for the first n elements.
2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**: Define a recursive function to compute the XOR value for any index beyond n using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Sum Calculation**: For the given range [l, r], split the calculation into two parts:
   - Sum of elements from l to min(r, n) using the precomputed values.
   - Sum of elements from max(l, n+1) to r using the recursive function, considering both even and odd indices separately to exploit the symmetry in their definitions.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

def main():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(input[idx]); idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, l, r = map(int, input[idx:idx+3]); idx +=3
        a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n])); idx +=n
        # Precompute prefix_xor
        prefix_xor = [0]*(n+1)
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i-1] ^ a[i-1]
        
        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def f(k):
            if k <=n:
                return prefix_xor[k]
            return f(k-1) ^ f(k//2)
        
        def compute_sum(a_part, b_part):
            res = 0
            for k in range(a_part, b_part+1):
                res += f(k)
            return res
        
        total =0
        # Sum for initial part
        low = l
        high = min(r, n)
        if low <= high:
            total += sum(a[low-1 : high])
        
        A = max(n+1, l)
        B = r
        if A > B:
            print(total)
            continue
        
        # Compute even and odd parts
        # Even m: m =2k
        even_start = A if A %2 ==0 else A+1
        even_end = B if B%2 ==0 else B-1
        sum_even =0
        if even_start <= even_end:
            a_even = even_start //2
            b_even = even_end //2
            sum_even = compute_sum(a_even, b_even)
        
        # Odd m: m=2k+1
        odd_start = A if A%2 ==1 else A+1
        odd_end = B if B%2 ==1 else B-1
        sum_odd =0
        if odd_start <= odd_end:
            a_odd = (odd_start -1) //2
            b_odd = (odd_end -1) //2
            sum_odd = compute_sum(a_odd, b_odd)
        
        total += sum_even + sum_odd
        print(total)
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array is precomputed to quickly access the cumulative XOR up to any given index within the initial n elements.
2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**: The function `f(k)` computes the XOR value for indices beyond n using memoization to optimize repeated calculations. This function leverages the recurrence relation and reduces redundant computations.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of elements in the range [l, r] is split into two parts:
   - Direct sum of elements from the initial array if they fall within the range.
   - Sum of elements beyond the initial array, considering even and odd indices separately to exploit their dependency on half-index values, computed using the memoized function.

This approach efficiently handles large indices by leveraging memoization and symmetry between even and odd indices, ensuring the solution remains feasible even for very large values of l and r.
