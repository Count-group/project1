To solve this problem, we need to transform a given sequence of non-negative integers into an arithmetic sequence with the minimum cost. An arithmetic sequence is defined by a starting element \( a_1 \) and a common difference \( k \). The goal is to determine the minimum cost by potentially replacing some elements, where each replacement has a specified cost.

### Approach
The solution involves the following steps:
1. **Check for the case where \( k = 0 \)**:
   - For \( k = 0 \), all elements in the sequence must be the same. We compute the cost by finding the most frequent element and summing the costs of elements that need to be replaced to match this element.

2. **Generate candidate \( k \) values from pairs of elements with high costs (b_i)**:
   - Select the top 200 elements with the highest replacement costs (b_i).
   - For each pair of these elements, compute the possible \( k \) values that would make them part of the same arithmetic sequence. These \( k \) values are derived from the differences between the elements.

3. **Check each candidate \( k \)**:
   - For each candidate \( k \), compute the potential starting element \( a_1 \) for each position in the sequence. Track the sum of costs for each valid \( a_1 \) and \( k \) combination, and determine the maximum sum of retained elements to minimize the replacement cost.

```python
import sys

def main():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    
    total_b = sum(b)
    if n == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    max_sum = 0
    # Handle k=0 case
    count = {}
    for ai, bi in zip(a, b):
        if ai in count:
            count[ai] += bi
        else:
            count[ai] = bi
    if count:
        current_max = max(count.values())
        if current_max > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_max
    
    # Select top 200 elements based on b_i
    top_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: -b[x])[:200]
    candidate_ks = set()
    
    # Generate candidate k's from pairs of top elements
    for i in range(len(top_indices)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(top_indices)):
            idx_i = top_indices[i]
            idx_j = top_indices[j]
            if idx_i == idx_j:
                continue
            if idx_i < idx_j:
                i1, i2 = idx_i, idx_j
            else:
                i1, i2 = idx_j, idx_i
            delta = a[i2] - a[i1]
            step = i2 - i1
            if step == 0:
                continue
            if delta % step != 0:
                continue
            k = delta // step
            if k >= 0:
                candidate_ks.add(k)
    
    # Also check k's from the first element to top elements
    first = 0
    for j in top_indices:
        if j <= first:
            continue
        delta = a[j] - a[first]
        step = j - first
        if step == 0:
            continue
        if delta % step != 0:
            continue
        k = delta // step
        if k >= 0:
            candidate_ks.add(k)
    
    # Check each candidate k
    for k in candidate_ks:
        current = {}
        for i in range(n):
            a1 = a[i] - i * k
            if a1 >= 0:
                if a1 in current:
                    current[a1] += b[i]
                else:
                    current[a1] = b[i]
        if current:
            current_max = max(current.values())
            if current_max > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_max
    
    print(total_b - max_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input values for the sequence and their respective costs are read.
2. **Handling \( k = 0 \)**: We create a frequency map to count the sum of costs for each unique element in the sequence. The maximum value in this map gives the best cost for \( k = 0 \).
3. **Generating Candidate \( k \) Values**: We select the top 200 elements with the highest replacement costs. For each pair of these elements, we compute potential \( k \) values that could form an arithmetic sequence and add them to a set of candidate \( k \) values.
4. **Checking Each Candidate \( k \)**: For each candidate \( k \), we compute the potential starting element \( a_1 \) for each position in the sequence. We use a dictionary to accumulate the costs for valid starting elements and track the maximum sum of retained elements.
5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum cost is derived by subtracting the maximum sum of retained elements from the total cost of all elements.

This approach efficiently checks feasible values of \( k \) derived from high-cost elements, ensuring that we consider likely candidates for the optimal solution while keeping the computation manageable.
