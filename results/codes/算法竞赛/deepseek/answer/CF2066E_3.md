To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it is possible to identify the poisonous barrel using a series of comparisons and pouring operations without touching the poisonous barrel. The solution involves checking for duplicates and ensuring that the sum of the weights of all barrels except the largest one is sufficient to detect the poison.

### Approach
1. **Check for Duplicates**: If there are at least two barrels with the same weight, we can compare them directly. If their weights are equal, they are non-poisonous, and we can use them safely. If they are not equal, the heavier one is the poisonous barrel.
2. **Sum Condition**: If there are no duplicates, we need to check if the sum of the weights of all barrels except the two largest ones is at least as large as the weight of the largest barrel. This ensures that even if the poisonous barrel is among the smaller barrels, we can still detect it by pouring water from non-poisonous barrels into the largest barrel.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    n, q = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])
    ptr += 2
    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))
    ptr += n
    
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for num in a:
        count[num] += 1
    
    def check():
        if any(v >= 2 for v in count.values()):
            return "Yes"
        if len(a) < 2:
            return "Yes"
        sum_total = sum(a)
        max_val = max(a)
        sum_others = sum_total - max_val
        
        # Find the second_max
        second_max = -1
        for num in a:
            if num != max_val and num > second_max:
                second_max = num
        if second_max == -1:
            return "Yes"  # all elements are max_val (impossible due to no duplicates)
        return "Yes" if (sum_others - second_max) >= max_val else "No"
    
    initial = check()
    print(initial)
    
    for _ in range(q):
        query = input[ptr]
        x = int(input[ptr+1])
        ptr += 2
        if query == '+':
            a.append(x)
            count[x] += 1
        else:
            a.remove(x)
            count[x] -= 1
            if count[x] == 0:
                del count[x]
        res = check()
        print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Check for Duplicates**: The code uses a frequency dictionary to track the count of each barrel's weight. If any weight appears at least twice, we can directly determine the result as "Yes".
2. **Sum Condition**: When there are no duplicates, the code calculates the sum of all barrels except the largest one. It then checks if this sum, minus the second largest barrel's weight, is at least as large as the largest barrel's weight. This ensures that even if the poisonous barrel is among the smaller barrels, we can still detect it by redistributing water from non-poisonous barrels into the largest barrel.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we can determine the poisonous barrel without touching it, adhering to the problem's requirements.
