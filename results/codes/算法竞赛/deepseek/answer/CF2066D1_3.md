To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid ways to fill in the gaps in a sequence of airplane launches such that each resident on each floor of a building meets certain constraints. Each resident must launch at least a minimum number of airplanes collectively, and each resident stops launching once they perceive enough airplanes have been launched.

### Approach
1. **Constraints Understanding**: Each resident on floor `i` must see at least `c` airplanes launched from floors 1 to `i` by the end of the day. Additionally, each resident will stop launching once they perceive at least `c` airplanes.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid sequences for the remaining `m - c` airplanes launched by residents from floors 2 to `n`. We track the number of ways to distribute these launches while ensuring each floor's contribution does not exceed `c`.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**: The solution involves calculating the number of valid sequences using combinatorial methods to distribute the remaining launches among higher floors, ensuring each floor's contribution does not exceed `c`.

### Solution Code
```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(input[idx])
    idx += 1
    
    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo MOD up to 1e4
    max_m = 10000
    fact = [1] * (max_m + 1)
    inv_fact = [1] * (max_m + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_m + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD
    inv_fact[max_m] = pow(fact[max_m], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i in range(max_m-1, -1, -1):
        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[idx])
        c = int(input[idx+1])
        m = int(input[idx+2])
        idx +=3
        idx +=m  # Skip the array as all are zeros
        
        if m < c or m > n * c:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # The first floor must have exactly c planes
        rem = m - c
        if rem < 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Dynamic programming to count the number of ways to distribute rem planes among floors 2..n, each <=c
        dp = [[0]*(rem+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        dp[1][0] = 1  # Base case: after floor 1, 0 planes remaining
        
        for floor in range(2, n+1):
            for prev_rem in range(rem+1):
                if dp[floor-1][prev_rem] == 0:
                    continue
                # Try adding k planes from this floor (0 <=k <= min(c, rem - prev_rem))
                max_k = min(c, rem - prev_rem)
                for k in range(0, max_k+1):
                    new_rem = prev_rem + k
                    dp[floor][new_rem] = (dp[floor][new_rem] + dp[floor-1][prev_rem]) % MOD
        
        total = dp[n][rem]
        
        # Compute combination C(m, c)
        comb = fact[m] * inv_fact[c] % MOD
        comb = comb * inv_fact[m - c] % MOD
        
        ans = total * comb % MOD
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Precomputation**: Factorials and inverse factorials are precomputed to efficiently calculate combinations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: We use a dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to distribute the remaining `m - c` airplane launches among floors 2 to `n`, ensuring each floor does not exceed `c` launches. The DP table `dp[floor][rem]` keeps track of the number of ways to distribute `rem` planes up to the given `floor`.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The number of ways to choose positions for the first floor's `c` launches among `m` total positions is calculated using combinations, ensuring the first floor's launches are placed after all others.

This approach efficiently combines dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics to solve the problem within the given constraints, ensuring that each resident's contribution does not exceed `c` and that the order of launches is valid.
