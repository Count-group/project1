To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected number of unordered pairs of distinct vertices that become leaves in a forest formed after some vertices fall with given probabilities. The solution involves leveraging linearity of expectation and efficiently computing probabilities using modular arithmetic.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Each vertex has a probability of falling, which affects the structure of the resulting forest.
   - A leaf in the forest is a vertex that remains and has exactly one neighbor remaining.
   - The goal is to compute the expected number of such leaf pairs.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - Use linearity of expectation to sum the probabilities of each pair of vertices being leaves.
   - For each vertex, compute the probability that it becomes a leaf considering its neighbors.
   - Handle adjacent pairs separately to account for their shared edge.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute the probability of each vertex being a leaf.
   - Calculate the expected number of pairs using these probabilities, adjusting for adjacent pairs which have a different contribution due to their shared edge.

### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Probabilities and their inverses are computed using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.
- **Adjacency List**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list to efficiently traverse neighbors.
- **Leaf Probability Calculation**: For each vertex, compute the probability of it becoming a leaf considering its neighbors' probabilities.
- **Expected Pairs Calculation**: The expected number of leaf pairs is computed using linearity of expectation, adjusting for adjacent pairs by correcting their contribution and handling non-adjacent pairs that share a common neighbor.
