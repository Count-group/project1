To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid ways to fill in the gaps in a sequence of airplane launches such that each resident on each floor of a building meets certain constraints. Each resident must launch at least a minimum number of airplanes collectively, and each resident stops launching once they perceive enough airplanes have been launched.

### Approach
1. **Constraints Understanding**: Each resident on floor `i` must see at least `c` airplanes launched from floors 1 to `i` by the end of the day. Additionally, each resident will stop launching once they perceive at least `c` airplanes.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid sequences for the remaining `m - c` airplanes launched by residents from floors 2 to `n`. We track the number of ways to distribute these launches while ensuring each floor's contribution does not exceed `c`.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**: The solution involves calculating the number of valid sequences using combinatorial methods to distribute the remaining launches among higher floors, ensuring each floor's contribution does not exceed `c`.

### Solution Code
```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(input[idx])
    idx += 1
    
    max_m = 10000
    fact = [1] * (max_m + 1)
    inv_fact = [1] * (max_m + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_m + 1):
        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD
    inv_fact[max_m] = pow(fact[max_m], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i in range(max_m-1, -1, -1):
        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[idx])
        c = int(input[idx+1])
        m = int(input[idx+2])
        idx +=3
        idx += m  # Skip the array as all are zeros
        
        if m < c or m > n * c:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        rem = m - c
        if rem < 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # The number of ways to distribute 'rem' planes among floors 2..n, each <=c
        # Using dynamic programming
        dp = [0] * (rem + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for j in range(2, n+1):
            new_dp = [0] * (rem + 1)
            for r in range(rem + 1):
                if dp[r] == 0:
                    continue
                max_k = min(c, rem - r)
                for k in range(0, max_k + 1):
                    new_dp[r + k] = (new_dp[r + k] + dp[r]) % MOD
            dp = new_dp
        
        total = dp[rem]
        
        # Compute the combination C(m, c)
        if c > m:
            comb = 0
        else:
            comb = fact[m] * inv_fact[c] % MOD
            comb = comb * inv_fact[m - c] % MOD
        
        ans = total * comb % MOD
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Precomputation**: Factorials and inverse factorials are precomputed to efficiently calculate combinations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: We use a dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to distribute the remaining `m - c` airplane launches among floors 2 to `n`, ensuring each floor does not exceed `c` launches.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The number of ways to choose positions for the `c` launches from the first floor among `m` total positions is calculated using combinations, ensuring the first floor's launches are placed after all others.

This approach efficiently combines dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics to solve the problem within the given constraints. The key insight is to ensure that each resident's contribution does not exceed `c` and that the order of launches is valid.
