To solve this problem, we need to determine the final state of a specific light after pressing each light in a row from 1 to n. Each press toggles the light's state and recursively toggles the states of its multiples. The key insight is to determine how many times each light is pressed and whether this count is odd or even.

### Approach
The problem can be reduced to checking if the light at position `k` is pressed an odd number of times. Through analysis, we observe that only the first light (position 1) is pressed an odd number of times. All other lights are pressed an even number of times due to the recursive nature of the presses. This is because each light `k` (where `k > 1`) is pressed once during the initial loop and once more during the processing of its divisors, resulting in an even count.

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    int T;
    cin >> T;
    while (T--) {
        int n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;
        cout << (k == 1 ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Key Insight**: The only light that is pressed an odd number of times is the first light (position 1). All other lights are pressed an even number of times because each light `k` (for `k > 1`) is pressed once during the initial loop and once more during the processing of its divisors.
- **Efficiency**: The solution runs in O(1) time per test case after reading the input, making it highly efficient even for the upper constraint of 100,000 test cases.
- **Correctness**: By checking if `k` is 1, we directly determine the result based on the parity of presses, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.
