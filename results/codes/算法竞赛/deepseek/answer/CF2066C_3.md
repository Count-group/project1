To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid sequences of operations where each step involves XORing one of P, Q, or R with a given array element such that after each step, all three variables are not pairwise distinct. The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently track valid sequences.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming States**:
   - **State A (dpA)**: All three variables (P, Q, R) are equal. This is represented as a dictionary where the key is the value of the variables and the value is the count of ways to reach this state.
   - **State B (dpB)**: Exactly two variables are equal, and the third is different. This is represented as a dictionary where the key is the value of the third variable and the value is the count of ways to reach this state.

2. **Transitions**:
   - **For a zero element**:
     - From State A: All three choices (P, Q, R) keep the variables equal, leading to State A.
     - From State B: All three choices keep two variables equal and the third different, leading to State B.
   - **For a non-zero element**:
     - From State A: Any choice transitions to State B with the XOR value of the element.
     - From State B: XORing the third variable transitions to another State B with an updated XOR value. If the element matches the current XOR value of the third variable, XORing one of the equal variables transitions to State B again with the same key but twice the count.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    t = int(input[ptr])
    ptr += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[ptr])
        ptr += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))
        ptr += n
        
        dpA = defaultdict(int)
        dpA[0] = 1  # Initially, all are 0
        dpB = defaultdict(int)
        
        for num in a:
            newA = defaultdict(int)
            newB = defaultdict(int)
            if num == 0:
                # Process zero element
                # Update newA
                for s, cnt in dpA.items():
                    newA[s] = (newA[s] + cnt * 3) % MOD
                # Update newB
                for s, cnt in dpB.items():
                    newB[s] = (newB[s] + cnt * 3) % MOD
            else:
                # Process non-zero element
                # Transition from A to B
                for s, cnt in dpA.items():
                    new_s = s ^ num
                    newB[new_s] = (newB[new_s] + cnt * 3) % MOD
                # Transition from B to B or A (but A is only when possible)
                for s, cnt in dpB.items():
                    # Assign to third variable (s -> s ^ num)
                    new_s = s ^ num
                    newB[new_s] = (newB[new_s] + cnt) % MOD
                    # Assign to one of the two 0 variables, if num == s
                    if num == s:
                        newB[s] = (newB[s] + cnt * 2) % MOD
            # Update dpA and dpB
            dpA, dpB = newA, newB
        
        total = 0
        for cnt in dpA.values():
            total = (total + cnt) % MOD
        for cnt in dpB.values():
            total = (total + cnt) % MOD
        print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **State Management**: The solution uses two dictionaries, `dpA` and `dpB`, to track the number of valid sequences where all variables are equal (State A) and where two variables are equal (State B).
- **Transitions**: For each element in the array, transitions between states are computed based on whether the element is zero or non-zero. Special handling for non-zero elements ensures valid transitions from State B to State B when the element matches the XOR value of the third variable.
- **Efficiency**: Using dictionaries to track states ensures efficient management of possible XOR values and their counts, avoiding unnecessary computations and ensuring linear time complexity relative to the input size.
