To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum lexicographical order of an array `a` after placing each ball in a tree according to specific rules. The key insight is that the tree structure and the given constraints ensure that each ball is placed in a node in the order of their indices, leading to the solution where the array `a` is simply the given permutation of the ball values.

### Approach
The problem constraints ensure that nodes are visited in order of their indices due to the depth condition (nodes with smaller indices are at the same or shallower depth than nodes with larger indices). This allows us to directly use the given permutation of ball values as the result. Each ball is placed into the tree nodes in the order of their indices, resulting in the minimum lexicographical order of the array `a`.

### Solution Code
```python
n = int(input())
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
for _ in range(n - 1):
    input()
print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:** The input consists of the number of nodes `n`, a permutation of values `p`, and the tree edges. The tree edges are read but not used because the solution leverages the depth constraint to directly use the permutation `p`.
2. **Output the Permutation:** The given permutation `p` is already the minimum lexicographical order due to the tree's structure and the way balls are placed in nodes according to their indices. Thus, we simply print the permutation `p`.

This approach efficiently solves the problem by recognizing the underlying structure constraints and their implications on the ball placement order.
