To solve this problem, we need to minimize the total fines imposed on Ella's factory by strategically renumbering the production lines. The key insight is to place the highest fines in positions that are covered by the fewest inspection intervals, thereby reducing their contribution to the total fines.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Coverage**: For each production line position, determine how many intervals include that position using a difference array to efficiently compute the coverage.
2. **Sort Positions by Coverage**: Sort the positions based on their coverage in ascending order. Positions with the same coverage are sorted by their indices.
3. **Assign Fines Strategically**: Assign the highest fines to the positions with the lowest coverage. This ensures that the highest fines are in positions that are least frequently inspected, minimizing their contribution to the total fines.
4. **Compute Total Fines**: For each interval, determine the maximum fine and sum these values to get the total fines.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

def main():
    n, k, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    intervals = []
    d = [0] * (n + 2)  # 1-based to n

    for _ in range(m):
        l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        intervals.append((l, r))
        d[l] += 1
        d[r + 1] -= 1

    # Compute coverage for each position
    current = 0
    coverage = [0] * (n + 1)  # coverage[0] unused
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current += d[i]
        coverage[i] = current

    # Sort positions by coverage ascending, then index ascending
    sorted_positions = sorted(range(1, n + 1), key=lambda x: (coverage[x], x))
    selected = sorted_positions[:k]

    # Assign fines in descending order to the least covered positions
    A = [0] * n
    for idx in range(k):
        pos = selected[idx]
        A[pos - 1] = k - idx  # Assign K, K-1, ..., 1

    # Calculate the sum of maxima for all intervals
    total = 0
    for l, r in intervals:
        max_fine = 0
        for i in range(l - 1, r):
            if A[i] > max_fine:
                max_fine = A[i]
        total += max_fine

    print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input includes the number of production lines, unqualified lines, and inspection intervals.
2. **Coverage Calculation**: Using a difference array, we efficiently compute how many times each position is covered by intervals.
3. **Sorting Positions**: Positions are sorted by coverage and then index to identify the least frequently covered positions.
4. **Assigning Fines**: The highest fines are assigned to the least covered positions to minimize their impact on the total fines.
5. **Summing Fines**: For each interval, the maximum fine is determined and summed to get the total fines, which is printed as the result.

This approach ensures that the highest fines are placed in the least frequently inspected intervals, thereby minimizing the total fines imposed on Ella's factory.
