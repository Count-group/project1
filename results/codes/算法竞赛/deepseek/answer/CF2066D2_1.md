To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid ways to fill in the gaps in a sequence of airplane launches such that each resident on each floor of a building sees at least `c` airplanes by the end of the day. The sequence must be filled in a way that each resident stops launching airplanes once they perceive that the required number of airplanes have been launched.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with State Tracking**: We use a dynamic programming approach where the state tracks the current number of airplanes launched by each resident and the number of airplanes seen by each resident up to the current step.
2. **Constraints Check**: For each step in the sequence, we check if the current resident can validly launch an airplane based on the number of airplanes seen so far from their floor and higher floors.
3. **Memoization**: Use memoization to efficiently compute the number of valid sequences by caching intermediate results.

                forced_val[i] = fixed[i]
                forced[i] = True
            else:
                forced_val[i] = -1

        # Now, we need to process the sequence step by step
        # We'll use DP: dp[pos][counts][sums] = number of ways
        # But this is too much. Instead, we can track for each floor the current sum >=j
        
        # Let's think of the state as for each step, for each j, the current sum of k >=j
        # But this is impossible for n=100. So we need another approach.
        
        # Alternative idea: the sum for j is the number of elements >=j up to the current step.
        # Since we process the sequence in order, we can track for each step the current sum of >=j for all j.
        # But this is O(n*m) states, which is 100*1e4 = 1e6 per test case. But with t=1e4, this is 1e10, which is impossible.
        
        # Another idea: For each step, track for each j the current sum of >=j.
        # But this is not feasible. So we need to find a way to compress the state.
        
        # We'll use a recursive approach with memoization, but optimized for the constraints.
        
        # Precompute the forced sequence and check if any forced step is invalid.
        # For each position i, if it's forced to j, then the sum of >=j up to i must be <c.
        
        # We'll simulate the process step by step, keeping track of the current sum for each j.
        # For each position, the possible choices depend on the current sum for each j.
        # We can represent the sum for each j as an array.
        
        # The state for the DP is the current position and an array of counts for each j.
        # But this is too large. Instead, we can track the sum for each j up to the current step.
        
        # However, even this is too large. So, we can note that for the sum of j, once it exceeds c, any further increments don't affect the validity of j's additions.
        # So, we can track the sum for each j as min(current sum, c).
        
        # This way, the state is the current position and a tuple of sums for each j, clamped to c.
        
        # Initialize the sum for each j as 0.
        # For each step, we can choose a j to fill in (if it's a gap), or use the forced value.
        # For each choice, we update the sums for j >= chosen_j.
        
        # Let's try this approach.
        
        # We need to track for each j, the current sum of >=j, clamped to c.
        # The state is a tuple of (sum_1, sum_2, ..., sum_n), where sum_j is the clamped sum for j.
        
        # But even this is O((c+1)^n), which is impossible for n=100.
        
        # Alternative idea: for each j, the sum_j can be represented as the minimum between the actual sum and c.
        # Because once the sum_j reaches c, adding more elements >=j won't change the sum_j (it's clamped to c).
        
        # So the state is a tuple of clamped sums.
        
        # For each step, we can iterate through the sequence and update the state accordingly.
        
        # Let's proceed.
        
        # Precompute the initial state: all sums are 0.
        # We'll use a list to represent the current clamped sums.
        
        # Let's define a recursive function with memoization.
        # But given the time constraints, perhaps we can use memoization with the current position and the clamped sums.
        # However, even with m=1e4 and clamped sums of up to c for each j, it's not feasible for n=100.
        
        # Therefore, this approach is not feasible.
        
        # Alternative Idea:
        # For each position, track the current sum for each j. However, this is not possible due to time constraints.
        # So, the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:
        
        # The number of valid sequences is the product of the possibilities for each position, given the constraints.
        # For each position, if it's fixed, check if the sum of >=j is valid. If not, return 0.
        # If it's a gap, sum the possibilities for each j that satisfies the constraints.
        
        # We can process the sequence step by step, keeping track of the sum for each j.
        # For each step, the sum for j is the number of elements >=j up to that step.
        # For each j, the sum must be <=c when placing j.
        # At the end, all sums must be >=c.
        
        # We can use memoization with the current position and the current sum for each j.
        # However, this is still O(m * (c+1)^n), which is not feasible.
        
        # Therefore, the problem is extremely complex, and the correct solution involves dynamic programming with optimized state tracking.
        # However, due to time and space constraints, the solution is to use memoization with the current position and the current sum for each j, clamped to c.
        
        # The code below is a simplified version of this approach.
        
        # Initialize the sum for each j to 0.
        # For each step, track the sum for each j.
        # For each position i, and current sums, try all possible choices for j (if it's a gap), and check if the sum of >=j is <c.
        
        # The code below uses memoization with lru_cache, but for large n and m, it's not feasible. However, given the problem constraints and test cases, it might work.
        
        # Precompute for each j, the current sum of >=j.
        # We'll represent the sum as a tuple of clamped sums (sum_1, sum_2, ..., sum_n), clamped to c.
        # However, for n=100, this is not feasible. Thus, this approach is not correct.
        
        # Given the time, we'll proceed with a memoization approach for small n and m.
        
        # But given that n can be up to 100, this is impossible.
        
        # The correct approach is to use dynamic programming with the following state:
        # dp[i][s_1][s_2]...[s_n] = number of ways to reach position i with sum s_j for each j.
        # But this is impossible for n=100.
        
        # Therefore, the problem is not solvable with standard DP approaches, and requires a combinatorial insight.
        
        # Given that the sum for j must be at least c, and during the sequence, each addition of j must be when the sum of >=j is <c.
        # The correct approach is to realize that the sum for j can be partitioned into two parts: the sum contributed by j and the sum contributed by higher floors.
        # For each j, the maximum number of times j can be added is c.
        # However, this is not enough.
        
        # Due to the complexity of the problem, the solution is not provided here.

### Explanation
The provided code outlines the approach to solve the problem using dynamic programming with state tracking, but due to the complexity and constraints, the actual implementation details are left incomplete. The key insight involves tracking the number of airplanes seen by each resident up to the current step and ensuring that each addition of a resident's airplane does not exceed the required count before they stop. The solution requires careful handling of the sequence constraints and efficient state management to count valid permutations.
