To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid sequences of operations where each step involves XORing one of P, Q, R with a given array element such that after each step, all three variables P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct. The solution involves dynamic programming to track the valid sequences efficiently.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming States**:
   - **State A**: All three variables (P, Q, R) are equal.
   - **State B**: Exactly two variables are equal, and the third is different. This state is tracked using a dictionary where the key is the XOR value of the third variable, and the value is the count of ways to reach this state.

2. **Transitions**:
   - **For a zero element**:
     - From State A: All three choices (P, Q, R) keep the variables equal, leading to State A.
     - From State B: All three choices keep two variables equal and the third different, leading to State B.
   - **For a non-zero element**:
     - From State A: Any choice transitions to State B with the XOR value of the element.
     - From State B: XORing the third variable transitions to another State B with updated XOR value. XORing one of the equal variables transitions to State A if the element matches the current XOR value of the third variable.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    t = int(input[ptr])
    ptr += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[ptr])
        ptr += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))
        ptr += n
        
        dpA = 1
        dpB = defaultdict(int)
        
        for num in a:
            if num == 0:
                newA = (dpA * 3) % MOD
                newB = defaultdict(int)
                for s, cnt in dpB.items():
                    newB[s] = (cnt * 3) % MOD
                dpA, dpB = newA, newB
            else:
                # Calculate new_dpA
                newA = (2 * dpB.get(num, 0)) % MOD
                # Calculate new_dpB
                newB = defaultdict(int)
                # Transition from A to B with s = num
                if dpA > 0:
                    newB[num] = (newB[num] + dpA * 3) % MOD
                # Transition from B by XORing the third variable
                for s, cnt in dpB.items():
                    new_s = s ^ num
                    newB[new_s] = (newB[new_s] + cnt) % MOD
                dpA, dpB = newA, newB
        
        total = (dpA + sum(dpB.values())) % MOD
        print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **State Management**: The solution uses two states, `dpA` and `dpB`, to track the number of valid sequences where all variables are equal (State A) and where two variables are equal (State B).
- **Transitions**: For each element in the array, transitions between states are computed based on whether the element is zero or non-zero.
- **Efficiency**: Using a dictionary to track State B ensures efficient management of possible XOR values and their counts, avoiding unnecessary computations.

This approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the solution is computed in linear time relative to the input size, making it suitable for large inputs.
