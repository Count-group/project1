To solve this problem, we need to determine if the spectator of the first match can also be the spectator of the k-th match in a series of table tennis matches played under specific rules. The key insight is to recognize the cyclic pattern in the spectator sequence.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Rules**: The players follow a rule where a player cannot play three times consecutively. This leads to a cyclic pattern in the spectators.
2. **Cyclic Pattern Analysis**: By analyzing the sequence of matches, we observe that the spectator sequence follows a cycle of 3. The spectator of the first match (S) will reappear every 3 matches (1st, 4th, 7th, etc.).
3. **Modulo Operation**: To determine if the k-th match can have the same spectator as the first match, we check if \( k \mod 3 \) equals 1. If true, the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO".

### Solution Code
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    k = int(input())
    print("YES" if k % 3 == 1 else "NO")
```

### Explanation
- **Cyclic Pattern**: The sequence of spectators repeats every 3 matches. The first spectator (S) will be the spectator again at positions 1, 4, 7, etc.
- **Modulo Check**: Using the modulo operation, we efficiently determine if the k-th position falls in the cycle where the spectator is S. If \( k \mod 3 = 1 \), it means k is part of the cycle starting at 1, hence the answer is "YES".

This approach efficiently solves the problem with a time complexity of O(1) per test case, making it suitable even for large values of k up to \( 10^9 \).
