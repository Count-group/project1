To solve this problem, we need to determine the final value of `x` after Alice and Bob play optimally, considering their goals of maximizing and minimizing `x` respectively. The game involves a multiset of numbers that are either 0 or powers of 2, and each player takes turns choosing an element and deciding whether to XOR it with `x`.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Alice starts first and aims to maximize `x`.
   - Bob follows and aims to minimize `x`.
   - The game is turn-based, and each player will always choose the highest available bit to influence the outcome maximally.
   - The presence of zeros affects the parity of the number of elements processed before each bit, thus influencing the starting player for each bit.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The outcome of each bit (whether it is set to 1 or 0) depends on the number of elements (count) of that bit and the starting player (Alice or Bob).
   - The starting player for each bit is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the total number of elements processed before that bit, including zeros.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Process each bit from the highest to the lowest.
   - For each bit, compute the starting player based on the parity of the sum of all higher bits processed so far and the effective parity of the zeros.
   - Determine the outcome of each bit based on whether the count of elements is odd or even and the starting player.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where k is the number of different bit positions. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Solution Code
```python
k, z = map(int, input().split())
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

outcomes = [0] * k
total = 0  # Sum of higher bits processed so far
parity_z = z % 2  # Parity of the number of zeros

for i in range(k-1, -1, -1):
    current_b = b[i]
    # Determine the starting parity based on total and zeros' parity
    starting_parity = (total + parity_z) % 2
    
    if current_b % 2 == 1:
        outcome = 1 if starting_parity == 0 else 0
    else:
        outcome = 1 if starting_parity == 1 else 0
    
    outcomes[i] = outcome
    total += current_b
    
    # Update parity_z based on remaining zeros and current total
    if z > 0:
        # After processing this bit, the parity can be adjusted using remaining zeros
        parity_z = (total % 2) ^ 1  # Try to flip the parity if possible
    else:
        parity_z = 0

# Generate the binary string from highest bit to lowest
binary = ''.join(str(outcomes[i]) for i in reversed(range(k)))
print(binary)
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the values of `k` (number of bits) and `z` (number of zeros).
   - Read the list `b` which contains the counts of each power of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(k-1)`.

2. **Processing Bits**:
   - Iterate from the highest bit (k-1) down to the lowest bit (0).
   - For each bit, compute the total number of elements processed before it (prefix sum) and adjust for the parity of zeros.
   - Determine the starting player based on whether the prefix sum (including zeros) is even or odd.
   - Calculate the outcome for the current bit based on its count and the starting player.

3. **Generating Output**:
   - Construct the binary result by iterating from the highest bit to the lowest and converting the outcomes list to a binary string.

This approach ensures that each bit's outcome is determined optimally, considering the strategies of both players and the presence of zeros, leading to the correct final value of `x` in binary form.
