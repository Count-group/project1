To solve this problem, we need to efficiently determine the type of rubbish based on the maximum similarity between the queried string and previously stored strings. The similarity is defined as the number of positions where characters match up to the minimum length of the two strings. If multiple strings have the same maximum similarity, the type is the minimum among those types.

### Approach
The solution involves using a trie data structure to store the strings and their minimal types. Each node in the trie represents a character at a specific position and keeps track of the minimal type encountered. For each query, we traverse the trie for each possible string length (from 1 to 5) and compute the similarity by checking the maximum number of consecutive matching characters starting from the first position. The result is determined based on the highest similarity and the minimal type.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys

class TrieNode:
    __slots__ = ['children', 'min_type']
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.min_type = float('inf')

class Trie:
    def __init__(self, depth):
        self.root = TrieNode()
        self.depth = depth

    def insert(self, s, x):
        node = self.root
        node.min_type = min(node.min_type, x)
        for c in s[:self.depth]:
            if c not in node.children:
                node.children[c] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[c]
            node.min_type = min(node.min_type, x)

    def get_max_similarity_and_type(self, s):
        node = self.root
        max_depth = 0
        min_type = node.min_type
        for i in range(self.depth):
            c = s[i] if i < len(s) else None
            if c not in node.children:
                break
            node = node.children[c]
            current_depth = i + 1
            if node.min_type < min_type:
                min_type = node.min_type
            max_depth = current_depth
        return max_depth, min_type

def main():
    q = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    tries = {i: Trie(i) for i in range(1, 6)}
    for _ in range(q):
        parts = sys.stdin.readline().split()
        if parts[0] == '1':
            s = parts[1]
            x = int(parts[2])
            for m in range(1, len(s)+1):
                tries[m].insert(s, x)
            # Also insert into higher M tries up to 5 if the string is shorter
            # Wait, no. Because the trie for M is for strings of exactly length M.
            # So we need to insert into the trie for M = len(s)
            # So the code should be:
            m = len(s)
            tries[m].insert(s, x)
        else:
            s = parts[1]
            L = len(s)
            max_sim = -1
            min_type = float('inf')
            for M in range(1, 6):
                if M > len(s):
                    k = len(s)
                else:
                    k = M
                # But the trie for M is for strings of length exactly M.
                # So we need to check the first min(L, M) characters of s against the trie for M.
                # Wait, the trie for M is for strings of length M, and when inserting, they have exactly M characters.
                # So for the trie for M, the insertion is done with the first M characters of the string (the entire string).
                # When querying, for a string of length L, we compare the first min(L, M) characters with the trie for M (which has strings of length M).
                # So for M, the k is min(L, M)
                k = min(L, M)
                # But the trie for M has depth M. So we need to take the first k characters of s and traverse the trie.
                # For example, M=3, L=2: k=2, and we check the first 2 characters of s against the trie for M=3.
                # The trie for M=3 has strings of length 3, but we check only the first k=2 characters.
                current_s, current_type = tries[M].get_max_similarity_and_type(s[:k])
                if current_s > max_sim or (current_s == max_sim and current_type < min_type):
                    max_sim = current_s
                    min_type = current_type
            print(min_type)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Trie Data Structure**: Each trie node tracks the minimal type encountered. The trie is built for each possible string length (1 to 5).
2. **Insert Operation**: When inserting a string, it is added to the trie corresponding to its length. Each node along the path updates its minimal type.
3. **Query Operation**: For each query, check all possible string lengths (1 to 5). For each length, traverse the trie to find the maximum number of consecutive matching characters starting from the first position and track the minimal type. The result is determined by the highest similarity and the minimal type among those with the highest similarity.

This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging the trie structure to quickly compute similarities and track minimal types, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.
