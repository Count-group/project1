Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to compute the sum of a binary sequence from l to r, inclusive. The sequence is defined in a special way: for m > n, a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) terms. Hmm. So, the problem is to find the sum of a_l to a_r, but considering that n can be up to 2e5 and l and r can be up to 1e18. That's a huge number, so we can't compute each term directly. We need a smart way to compute this.

First, let's understand how the sequence is built. For each term after the first n, a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) terms. Wait, wait. Wait, the definition says a_m is the XOR of a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{floor(m/2)}. So for any m > n, a_m is the cumulative XOR up to floor(m/2). So, for example, m = n+1: a_{n+1} = XOR of a_1 to a_{floor((n+1)/2)}.

But how does this sequence evolve? Let's think recursively. Because each term depends on the sum (XOR) of a range up to half of its index.

This feels like a problem where the sequence has some kind of pattern or recurrence that can be exploited. But for large m, how can we compute a_m quickly?

The key here is to find a way to represent a_m in terms of the cumulative XOR up to some point, and then find patterns or periodicity in the sequence.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the sequence in terms of a tree-like structure, where each a_m depends on a_k for k up to m/2. But even that might not be feasible for m up to 1e18.

Let me think about the cumulative XOR. Let's denote prefix_xor[i] as the XOR of a_1 to a_i. Then, a_m is prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ] for m > n. But wait, prefix_xor is the cumulative XOR up to i. So, when we compute a_m, it's equal to the prefix_xor of floor(m/2). Wait, no: the XOR of a_1 to a_{k} is prefix_xor[k], where prefix_xor[0] = 0, and prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i-1] XOR a_i. So for a_m where m > n, a_m = prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ].

Wait, but the definition says that a_m is the XOR of a_1 up to a_{floor(m/2)}, which is exactly prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ] (assuming prefix_xor[0] is 0). So yes.

So for m > n, a_m is equal to the prefix XOR up to floor(m/2). But then, how does this affect the prefix_xor array? Because once a_m is added to the sequence, the prefix_xor for m would be prefix_xor[m-1] XOR a_m. But for m > n, we can't precompute this because m can be up to 1e18.

So the problem is that the value of a_m for large m depends on the prefix_xor of floor(m/2), which in turn depends on previous terms. So this seems recursive.

But how can we compute a_m efficiently for a given m?

Let me try to see for some small example. Let's take n=2, a_1=1, a_2=0.

So the first two terms are 1 and 0. The prefix_xor for 1 is 1, for 2 is 1 XOR 0 = 1.

Then a_3 is the prefix_xor of floor(3/2) = 1. So a_3 = 1. Then prefix_xor[3] = prefix_xor[2] XOR a_3 = 1 XOR 1 = 0.

a_4: floor(4/2) = 2. prefix_xor[2] is 1. So a_4=1. prefix_xor[4] = 0 XOR 1 = 1.

a_5: floor(5/2) = 2. So a_5 = 1. prefix_xor[5] = 1 XOR 1 = 0.

a_6: floor(6/2)=3. prefix_xor[3] is 0. So a_6=0. prefix_xor[6] = 0 XOR 0 = 0.

Wait, but how is a_6 computed? Wait, floor(6/2) is 3. So a_6 is the XOR of the first 3 terms (a_1, a_2, a_3), which is 1 XOR 0 XOR 1 = 0. So a_6 is 0.

But the prefix_xor up to 3 is 0. So yes, a_6 is equal to that.

So the sequence for this example is:

a_1 =1

a_2=0

a_3=1 (XOR of first 1 elements)

a_4=1 (XOR of first 2 elements)

a_5=1 (XOR of first 2 elements)

a_6=0 (XOR of first 3 elements)

a_7: floor(7/2) is 3. XOR up to 3 is 0. So a_7=0.

a_8: floor(8/2)=4. XOR up to 4 is 1. So a_8=1.

So the sequence continues with a_3=1, a_4=1, a_5=1, a_6=0, a_7=0, a_8=1, etc.

But how can we model this for large m?

An alternative approach: for a given m, find a way to compute a_m based on some pattern or recurrence. Let's note that a_m is equal to the prefix_xor of floor(m/2). But floor(m/2) is m//2 in integer division.

So for m > n, a_m is the prefix_xor of (m//2). But then, to compute prefix_xor of (m//2), which is m//2 terms. But m//2 can be up to 5e17 when m is 1e18. So even that is impossible.

So we need a way to compute a_m without traversing all the way up to m.

Let me think recursively. Let's consider that for m > n, a_m = prefix_xor[k], where k = m//2. Now, prefix_xor[k] is the cumulative XOR of the first k elements. But the first n elements are given. For k <=n, prefix_xor[k] is known. But for k >n, prefix_xor[k] is the cumulative XOR up to k elements, which includes the given a_1..a_n and the generated a_{n+1}..a_k.

But how can we compute prefix_xor[k] for k >n? For example, if k is in (n, ...), then prefix_xor[k] = prefix_xor[k-1] XOR a_k. But a_k is the prefix_xor of (k//2). So this is a recursive definition.

This seems like a problem where each term depends on previous terms, but perhaps the structure allows for some memoization or pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that after a certain point, the sequence a_m becomes periodic or follows some pattern based on the parity of m or some other property.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the value of a_m can be determined by the binary representation of m. For example, each time you divide m by 2, you might get a path that leads to a position within the initial n terms.

Let me think: for a given m, a_m is the prefix_xor of (m//2). But the prefix_xor of (m//2) is the XOR up to m//2 terms. Now, m//2 can be greater than n, so we need to compute the prefix_xor of m//2, which in turn depends on the a_{m//2} term, which is the prefix_xor of (m//2 // 2) = m//4. And so on, until we reach a term that is <=n.

Wait, this seems like a chain. For example, to compute a_m, we need to compute prefix_xor of m//2. Let's say m//2 is k. To compute prefix_xor[k], which is the XOR of the first k terms. If k <=n, then we can directly get it from the initial array. Otherwise, prefix_xor[k] = prefix_xor[k-1] XOR a_k. But a_k is prefix_xor[k//2]. So again, this is a recursive step.

So the process is:

prefix_xor[k] = prefix_xor[k-1] XOR a_k

But a_k = prefix_xor[k//2]

So for k >n:

prefix_xor[k] = prefix_xor[k-1] XOR prefix_xor[k//2]

But how can we compute this efficiently?

This seems like a recursive function that could have a lot of overlapping subproblems. But for m up to 1e18, even memoization is impossible unless there's some pattern or cycle.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a memoization with some memo table, but given the constraints, that's impossible for large m.

Another approach: Let's think of the problem as building a binary tree where each node m has a parent floor(m/2). Then, the value of a_m depends on the cumulative XOR up to the parent. But the cumulative XOR up to the parent is the sum of the path from the parent down to the root (the initial n terms). However, I'm not sure.

Wait, for a given m, the value a_m is prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ]. So a_m is determined by the cumulative XOR up to floor(m/2). Let's denote k = floor(m/2). Then, a_m is the cumulative XOR of the first k terms. So if k is <=n, then we can directly compute it. Otherwise, the cumulative XOR up to k is the same as the sum (XOR) of the first n terms plus the sum of terms from n+1 to k. But those terms from n+1 to k each are determined in the same way.

But again, how to compute the cumulative XOR for large k?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the cumulative XOR as a function that can be broken down into parts. Let's consider that for any k, the prefix_xor[k] can be written as the prefix_xor of the first n terms XOR the XOR of a_{n+1} ... a_k. Let's denote the first part as pre_xor = prefix_xor[n]. Then, for k >n, the prefix_xor[k] is pre_xor XOR (a_{n+1} XOR a_{n+2} ... XOR a_k).

But even that, how to compute the XOR of a_{n+1} to a_k?

But each a_m for m >n is equal to the prefix_xor of floor(m/2). So for m in n+1..k, a_m is the prefix_xor of floor(m/2). So the XOR of a_{n+1} ... a_k is the XOR of all prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ] for m from n+1 to k.

But this seems very complicated.

Another idea: Let's note that the sequence a_m for m >n is built in a way that each term is the cumulative XOR of the first half. So perhaps after some steps, the sequence becomes periodic. For example, if the cumulative XOR up to a certain point starts repeating, then the subsequent terms may form a cycle.

But how likely is that? It's possible, but difficult to predict. Let's see with the sample input.

Sample input 1: n=1, a_1=1. So for m>1, a_m is the prefix_xor of floor(m/2). The prefix_xor for floor(m/2) can be 1 (if floor(m/2) is >=1). So a_2 is prefix_xor[1] (since 2//2=1). a_2=1. prefix_xor[2] = 1 XOR 1=0. Then a_3 is prefix_xor[1] (3//2=1). a_3=1. prefix_xor[3] =0 XOR1=1. a_4: 4//2=2. prefix_xor[2] is 0. So a_4=0. prefix_xor[4] =1 XOR0=1. a_5: 5//2=2. prefix_xor[2] is 0. a_5=0. prefix_xor[5] =1 XOR0=1. a_6: 6//2=3. prefix_xor[3] is1. a_6=1. prefix_xor[6] =1 XOR1=0. a_7: 7//2=3. a_7=1. prefix_xor[7]=0 XOR1=1. a_8:8//2=4. prefix_xor[4]=1. So a_8=1. prefix_xor[8]=1 XOR1=0.

So looking at the a_m sequence for m>1:

m | a_m
2 |1
3 |1
4 |0
5 |0
6 |1
7 |1
8 |1
9 | (8//2=4. prefix_xor[4]=1. So a_9=1. prefix_xor[9] =0 XOR1=1)
10: 10//2=5. prefix_xor[5]=1. a_10=1. prefix_xor[10] =1 XOR1=0.

So the a sequence for m>=1 is [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1, ...]. Wait, the sample explanation says in the first test case, a_1=1, and the sequence is [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,...]. But according to the calculation, a_2 is 1 (from prefix_xor[1] which is 1). So the sample explanation seems to have a sequence where after a_1, the a_m are 1 for m=2,3, then 0,0,1, etc.

Hmm. So perhaps the sequence has some pattern, but it's not straightforward.

Another observation: Each a_m for m>n is determined by the XOR up to floor(m/2). So the value of a_m depends on the parity of floor(m/2). Or perhaps, there's a way to represent m in binary and find a path of divisions by 2 until we reach a value <=n.

For example, to compute a_m, we can write a recursive function:

def get_a(m):
    if m <=n:
        return a[m]
    else:
        k = m//2
        return get_prefix_xor(k)

But get_prefix_xor(k) is the cumulative XOR of the first k terms. Which is:

def get_prefix_xor(k):
    if k <=n:
        return pre_xor[k]
    else:
        return get_prefix_xor(k-1) ^ get_a(k)

But again, for k up to 1e18, this is impossible to compute directly. So perhaps memoization is needed, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the path of k's for a given m can be represented in terms of the binary representation of m. For example, each time you divide m by 2, you get a new value. Let's see, for m=1e18, how many steps would it take to reach a value <=n? Since each step divides by 2, it's logarithmic. So for m up to 1e18, the number of steps is about 60 (since 2^60 is ~1e18). That's manageable.

So here's the idea: For any m, to compute a_m, we can follow the chain of divisions by 2 until we reach a value k <=n. Then, the a_m is the XOR of the first k elements. But wait, a_m is equal to the prefix_xor of k, which is the XOR of the first k elements.

But the problem is, how to compute the prefix_xor of k when k is <=n. But that's precomputed. So for the initial terms, we can precompute the prefix_xor array up to n.

So the steps to compute a_m would be:

1. For a given m, generate the chain of m → m//2 → (m//2)//2 → ... until the value is <=n.

2. Compute the prefix_xor for that final value (which is known, since it's <=n).

3. But wait, no. Because for example, a_m is the prefix_xor of floor(m/2). But floor(m/2) could be greater than n, which would require a recursive computation.

Wait, the steps are:

For m >n:

a_m = prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ]

But prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ] is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements. If floor(m/2) >n, then this is the XOR of the first n elements, followed by the XOR of the generated elements from n+1 to floor(m/2).

So the problem is that to compute the prefix_xor for a large k, which is the cumulative XOR up to k elements, which includes some generated terms.

But how can we compute this?

Alternative approach: For a given k, compute the cumulative XOR up to k elements. Let's model this as a function f(k) which returns the cumulative XOR up to k terms.

If k <=n: f(k) is the precomputed prefix_xor[k].

If k >n: f(k) = f(k-1) XOR a_k. But a_k is equal to f(k//2).

So f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2).

So the problem now is to compute f(k), which can be done recursively. However, for k up to 1e18, this is impossible to compute directly. But perhaps there's a way to memoize f(k) for certain k or find a pattern.

But how?

Let's think of f(k) as a function that can be computed based on the binary representation of k, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2). Hmm. Let's try to see for some values.

Suppose n=1, a_1=1. So f(1) =1.

For k=2: since 2>1, a_2 is f(1) =1. So f(2) = f(1) XOR a_2 = 1 XOR 1 =0.

k=3: a_3 is f(1) (3//2=1). So a_3=1. f(3)=0 XOR1=1.

k=4: a_4 is f(2)=0. f(4)=1 XOR0=1.

k=5: a_5 is f(2)=0. f(5)=1 XOR0=1.

k=6: a_6 is f(3)=1. f(6)=1 XOR1=0.

k=7: a_7 is f(3)=1. f(7)=0 XOR1=1.

k=8: a_8 is f(4)=1. f(8)=1 XOR1=0.

So the f(k) for k>1 is: 0,1,1,1,0,1,0, etc. Not sure about the pattern.

But perhaps for even and odd k, there's a different recurrence.

Wait, for even k:

k =2m. Then f(k) =f(2m) = f(2m-1) XOR f(m).

For odd k=2m+1: f(2m+1) = f(2m) XOR f(m).

But this may not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity of m plays a role. But even this, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(k) can be represented as a sum over the binary digits of k, but I can't see how.

Another idea: Since the problem requires the sum of a_l to a_r, which is sum_{m=l}^r a_m. Each a_m is equal to f( floor(m/2) ) when m>n.

So for each m in [l, r], if m <=n, then a_m is known. For m>n, it's f( floor(m/2) ).

But f( floor(m/2) ) is the prefix_xor of floor(m/2). Wait, no. a_m is the prefix_xor of floor(m/2), which is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) terms. But that's the same as f( floor(m/2) ).

So, to compute a_m for m>n, we need to compute f( floor(m/2) ).

But to compute f( floor(m/2) ), which is the cumulative XOR up to floor(m/2) terms, which again requires the same recursive steps.

This seems like a dead end.

But maybe there's a way to compute f(k) for a given k quickly using memoization and some observations about the recurrence.

But for the constraints given (t up to 1e4, and n up to 2e5), and with each query possibly requiring up to 1e18 terms, we need a solution that can compute the sum in O(log m) time per query.

Another approach: Precompute for each possible k, but since k can be up to 1e18, that's impossible.

Alternative idea: For a given m>n, a_m = f(m//2), where f(k) is the cumulative XOR up to k terms. So, when m is even, m=2k, then a_{2k} = f(k). Similarly, a_{2k+1} = f(k).

Wait, that's interesting. For even m=2k: floor(m/2) =k. So a_{2k} =f(k).

For odd m=2k+1: floor(m/2) =k. So a_{2k+1} =f(k).

So for any m, if m>n, then a_m is f(k) where k= floor(m/2).

But since a_m is f(k), and k can be up to 1e18, but m is even or odd, perhaps there's a pattern.

But how can this help in computing the sum?

Wait, let's consider all even numbers and odd numbers. For each k, the even and odd terms of m=2k and m=2k+1 will have a_m equal to f(k). So for k in some range, the terms a_{2k} and a_{2k+1} are both f(k). So their sum is 0 if f(k) is 0, and 2 if f(k) is 1. Or sum is 2*f(k).

This suggests that consecutive even and odd terms can be grouped together. So for a range of m's, if they include pairs of even and odd terms, their contribution to the sum is 2*f(k) for each pair.

But how can we exploit this?

For example, if we have a range of numbers from l to r where l is even and r is odd, then the number of pairs is (r - l +1)//2, and each pair contributes 2*f(k) if k is the same for both terms. But wait, in that case, for m=2k and 2k+1, the k is the same. So the pair (2k, 2k+1) contributes 2*f(k).

So if the range includes all even and odd numbers in a certain k range, we can compute the sum as 2 * sum(f(k)) over the k's in that range, multiplied by the number of such pairs.

But when there's an odd number of terms, like from l to r where (r-l+1) is even or odd, we need to handle the remainder.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can split the problem into intervals of even and odd terms, compute their contributions based on the k value.

But even this, how to compute sum(f(k)) for certain ranges of k.

But even if we can find a way to compute the sum for a range of k's, we need to model the sum of a_m in terms of the sum of f(k) for certain k ranges.

So, let's think of the sequence of a_m for m >n:

For m >n, each a_m is f(k) where k = m//2.

So for each m >n, a_m is equal to f(k), where k is floor(m/2).

So the terms for m >n can be grouped as follows:

- All m that are even (m=2k) and greater than n. So for these, a_m is f(k-1), since m//2 =k.

Wait, no: m=2k, then floor(m/2) =k. So a_{2k} =f(k).

Similarly, m=2k+1: floor(m/2) =k. So a_{2k+1} =f(k).

So for each k >=1, the even term 2k and the odd term 2k+1 will have a_m equal to f(k).

But what if m=2k is greater than n? Then the a_m is f(k). But f(k) is the cumulative XOR up to k terms.

But again, this depends on whether k is <=n or not.

But for the sum of a_l to a_r, we can split the sum into:

sum_{m=l}^r a_m = sum of a_m for m <=n in [l, r] + sum of a_m for m >n in [l, r].

So the first part is straightforward: just add the initial a_m's that are within [l, r].

The second part is the sum of a_m for m in [max(l, n+1), r], where each a_m is f(k) where k = m//2.

So for this part, we can model the sum as follows:

For each m in [A, B], where A = max(l, n+1), B = r, and m >n:

sum_{m=A}^B a_m = sum_{k= floor(A/2)}^{floor(B/2)} (number of m in [A,B] where floor(m/2) =k) * f(k)

But how to compute this.

For example, for a given k, how many m in [A, B] have floor(m/2) =k?

Well, floor(m/2) =k when m is in [2k, 2k+1].

So for each k, the possible m's are 2k and 2k+1. So in the interval [A, B], the count of m's with floor(m/2) =k is the number of integers in [A, B] that are in [2k, 2k+1].

So for each k, the count is:

max(0, min(B, 2k+1) - max(A, 2k) + 1) if 2k <=2k+1 and the interval [A,B] intersects [2k, 2k+1].

So, the sum becomes the sum over k of (count) * f(k).

But how to find the k's where [2k, 2k+1] overlaps with [A,B].

The k's for which 2k >=A and 2k+1 <=B are in the range [ceil(A/2), floor((B-1)/2)].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the range of k's for which there exists m in [A, B] such that floor(m/2) =k.

The minimum k is floor(A/2), and the maximum k is floor(B/2).

So for k in [k_min, k_max], compute the number of m in [A, B] where floor(m/2) =k.

So the problem reduces to, for each k in [k_min, k_max], compute the count, multiply by f(k), and sum all these.

But for large A and B (up to 1e18), k_min and k_max can be up to 5e17. So iterating through all possible k's in this range is impossible.

Thus, we need a way to compute sum_{k=k_min}^{k_max} (count(k) * f(k)) without iterating each k.

But how can we compute this sum efficiently, given that f(k) is a complex function?

The key challenge is to find an efficient way to compute the sum of f(k) over a range of k's, multiplied by their respective counts.

But f(k) is the cumulative XOR up to k terms. For k <=n, f(k) is known. For k >n, f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) ), which is a recursive function.

But again, for large k, we can't compute this directly.

But perhaps there's a way to memoize f(k) and compute it using memoization with a cache. However, even with memoization, for k up to 1e18, the number of unique calls could be O(log k) per query, which may be manageable since each query involves O(log k) steps.

So here's the plan:

For each test case:

1. Precompute the prefix_xor array up to n.

2. For the given l and r:

   a. Compute the sum of a_m from l to min(r, n). Add this to the answer.

   b. For the part where m >n (i.e., from max(n+1, l) to r), compute the sum by breaking it into ranges of k and counting how many times each f(k) appears.

3. For each m in the range (max(n+1, l), r), a_m is f( floor(m/2) ).

   So, the sum is sum_{k=k_min}^{k_max} (count_in_range(k) * f(k)).

   Where k_min is floor(max(n+1, l)/2), and k_max is floor(r/2).

   But for each k in [k_min, k_max], count_in_range(k) is the number of m in [A, B] such that floor(m/2) =k. As discussed earlier, this can be computed as follows:

   For a given k, the possible m's are 2k and 2k+1. So the count is:

   start_m = max(A, 2k)

   end_m = min(B, 2k+1)

   if start_m > end_m: count is 0

   else: count is end_m - start_m +1

But for large k ranges, how do we compute this?

The key insight here is that for a given range of k, the count can be represented as a function of k. However, the counts vary based on whether 2k and 2k+1 are within [A, B].

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the range of k can be split into several intervals where the count is a linear function of k.

For example, for k where 2k >= A and 2k+1 <= B:

count is 2 (since both 2k and 2k+1 are included).

For k where 2k >=A and 2k+1 > B:

count is B - 2k +1 if B >=2k.

For k where 2k+1 <= B and 2k <A:

count is (2k+1 -A +1) if 2k+1 >=A.

Otherwise, 0.

But handling all these cases for a large k range is tricky.

But perhaps we can find the start and end k's for each of these cases and compute the sum for each case.

For example:

- Case 1: 2k >=A and 2k+1 <=B. So count is 2. The k's here are in the range [ceil(A/2), floor((B-1)/2)].

Wait, no. Wait, 2k >=A → k >= ceil(A/2), and 2k+1 <=B → 2k <= B-1 → k <= (B-1)/2. So k can be from ceil(A/2) to floor( (B-1)/2 ). For these k's, count is 2.

- Case 2: 2k >=A but 2k+1 > B. So count is B - 2k +1, but this is only possible if 2k <= B. But since 2k+1 >B → 2k >= B → 2k >=B → k >= ceil(B/2). But if 2k >=B, then B -2k +1 is <=0, which implies no count. So this case may not contribute.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can split the range of k into three intervals:

1. k where 2k < A → no contribution.

2. k where 2k >=A and 2k+1 <=B → count is 2.

3. k where 2k >=A and 2k+1 > B → count is (B - 2k +1) if 2k <= B.

But perhaps it's easier to find the start and end of each possible case and compute the sum for each.

Alternatively, the count for a particular k is the number of m in [A, B] that are in [2k, 2k+1].

Which is the same as the intersection of [A, B] and [2k, 2k+1]. The length of this intersection is max(0, min(B, 2k+1) - max(A, 2k) + 1).

But how to compute this for all k in [k_min, k_max]?

The problem now is to compute sum_{k = k_min}^{k_max} [max(0, min(B, 2k+1) - max(A, 2k) +1)] * f(k)

This seems very difficult to compute directly.

But perhaps we can model this as two separate parts: the even m's and the odd m's.

Because for each k, the even m is 2k and the odd m is 2k+1. So the count for even m's is how many even m's in [A, B] where m is even and m/2 =k. Similarly for odd m's.

Wait, for even m: m=2k → k = m//2. So for even m in [A, B], the count is 1 for each k where 2k is in [A, B]. Similarly for odd m's.

So the sum can be split into two parts:

sum_even = sum_{m in even, m >=A, m <=B} a_m = sum_{k=ceil(A/2)}^{floor(B/2)} a_{2k} = sum_{k=ceil(A/2)}^{floor(B/2)} f(k)

sum_odd = sum_{m in odd, m >=A, m <=B} a_m = sum_{k=ceil((A-1)/2)}^{floor((B-1)/2)} a_{2k+1} = sum_{k=ceil((A-1)/2)}^{floor((B-1)/2)} f(k)

So the total sum for m >=A and <=B is sum_even + sum_odd.

But how to compute the ranges for even and odd m's.

For even m:

The even m's in [A, B] are those where m is even and A <=m <=B. The minimal even m >=A is A if A is even, else A+1. The maximal even m <=B is B if B is even, else B-1. The number of even m's is (max_even - min_even)/2 +1. The sum_even is the sum of f(k) for k in [min_even//2, max_even//2].

Similarly for odd m's:

The odd m's in [A, B] are m from A_odd to B_odd. The minimal odd m >=A is A if it's odd, else A+1. The maximal odd m <=B is B if it's odd, else B-1. The number of odd m's is (max_odd - min_odd)/2 +1. The sum_odd is the sum of f(k) for k in [ (min_odd-1)/2 , (max_odd-1)/2 ].

So the sum for m >=A and m <=B is sum_even + sum_odd = sum_{k in even_ks} f(k) + sum_{k in odd_ks} f(k).

But even_ks is [min_even_k ... max_even_k], where min_even_k = min_even // 2, max_even_k = max_even //2.

Similarly for odd_ks.

But even this, for large ranges, the number of k's can be up to 1e18. So how to compute these sums quickly.

The crux of the problem is to compute the sum of f(k) over a range of k's, where f(k) is defined recursively.

So the key is to find a way to compute the sum of f(k) from a to b, inclusive.

Now, the function f(k) is defined as:

f(0) = 0 (base case, perhaps)

for k <=n: f(k) = prefix_xor[k]

for k >n: f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2)

This is a recurrence relation. To compute f(k) for k up to 1e18, we need to find a way to memoize or compute this efficiently.

But even with memoization, for k up to 1e18, the number of unique calls may be manageable if each call reduces the problem size by a factor of 2. For example, each call to f(k) involves f(k-1) and f(k//2). But this is a branching factor of 2, which would lead to O(k) time. Which is not feasible.

But perhaps there's a way to find that f(k) has certain properties, such as periodicity or a pattern when represented in binary.

Alternatively, perhaps we can memoize f(k) for values of k that we have computed before, but given the size of k, this is only feasible if the number of unique k's encountered per query is small.

But given that each query can require summing f(k) over a large range of k's, this approach may not be feasible.

Alternative idea: Since f(k) is a binary value (0 or 1), maybe there's a way to model the sum as the count of 1's in the range, which is the same as the sum of f(k).

So sum of f(k) from a to b is the number of times f(k) is 1 in [a, b].

But how to compute this count.

But even if we can model the sum as the count of 1's, we need a way to compute that count.

But the problem remains of how to compute f(k) for each k in the range [a, b], which is required to compute the sum.

Another approach: For a given k, the value of f(k) can be computed using memoization with memo, but memoizing each k is not feasible for large k. However, for each test case, we can use a cache to store computed f(k) values. Since each test case can involve up to O(log k) steps per query, and there are up to 1e4 test cases, this may be manageable.

Let's try to model f(k) with memoization.

We can precompute the prefix_xor array up to n. For k >n, f(k) is f(k-1) XOR f(k//2).

But to compute this recursively, for each k>n, we need to compute f(k-1) and f(k//2). So for a given k, the number of steps needed is O(log k), since each step reduces k by half.

But for sum queries that require f(k) for many k's, this approach may be too slow.

But perhaps we can find that for certain ranges of k, the function f(k) has a pattern that can be exploited.

Alternatively, we can memoize f(k) for values of k that are computed during the recursion. Since each recursive call to f(k) may involve k//2, which is smaller than k, the number of unique k's that need to be computed per query is O(log k).

For example, for k=1e18, the recursive calls will be to f(1e18-1) and f(5e17). Then f(1e18-1) requires f(1e18-2) and f((1e18-1)//2) = 5e17. And so on. This suggests that the number of unique k's processed for a single f(k) is O(log k), which is manageable for 1e18 (since log2(1e18) is ~60).

So using memoization, perhaps we can compute f(k) for each required k efficiently.

So the plan is:

- Precompute prefix_xor up to n.

- For each k >n, compute f(k) as f(k-1) XOR f(k//2), using memoization.

- When computing the sum of f(k) over a range a to b, compute f(k) for each k in a to b, and sum them.

But for a range a to b where a and b are up to 1e18, this is impossible. So this approach is not feasible for large ranges.

Thus, we need a different approach.

Alternative idea: Find that the function f(k) has a pattern where the sum over a range can be computed using some mathematical formula, without computing each f(k) individually.

But this requires finding such a pattern, which is not obvious.

Let me think about the recurrence for f(k):

For k >n, f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) )

This is a non-linear recurrence relation, which makes it difficult to find a pattern.

Let's try to compute f(k) for some values beyond n.

Example: n=1, a_1=1. So prefix_xor[1] =1.

For k>1:

f(2) = f(1) XOR f(1) = 1 XOR1 =0

f(3) = f(2) XOR f(1) =0 XOR1=1

f(4)= f(3) XOR f(2)=1 XOR0=1

f(5)=f(4) XOR f(2)=1 XOR0=1

f(6)=f(5) XOR f(3)=1 XOR1=0

f(7)=f(6) XOR f(3)=0 XOR1=1

f(8)=f(7) XOR f(4)=1 XOR1=0

f(9)=f(8) XOR f(4)=0 XOR1=1

f(10)=f(9) XOR f(5)=1 XOR1=0

f(11)=f(10) XOR f(5)=0 XOR1=1

f(12)=f(11) XOR f(6)=1 XOR0=1

f(13)=f(12) XOR f(6)=1 XOR0=1

f(14)=f(13) XOR f(7)=1 XOR1=0

f(15)=f(14) XOR f(7)=0 XOR1=1

f(16)=f(15) XOR f(8)=1 XOR0=1

Looking at the sequence of f(k) for k>=1:

k | f(k)
1 |1
2 |0
3 |1
4 |1
5 |1
6 |0
7 |1
8 |0
9 |1
10|0
11|1
12|1
13|1
14|0
15|1
16|1

Hmm, it's not obvious if there's a pattern here. Maybe there's a cycle or some other structure.

Another example: n=2, a_1=1, a_2=0.

prefix_xor[1]=1, prefix_xor[2]=1.

k=3: f(3) = f(2) XOR f(1) =1 XOR1=0.

k=4: f(4) =f(3) XOR f(2) =0 XOR1=1.

k=5: f(5) =f(4) XOR f(2) =1 XOR1=0.

k=6: f(6) =f(5) XOR f(3) =0 XOR0=0.

k=7: f(7) =f(6) XOR f(3) =0 XOR0=0.

k=8: f(8) =f(7) XOR f(4) =0 XOR1=1.

k=9: f(9) =f(8) XOR f(4) =1 XOR1=0.

This sequence also doesn't show an obvious pattern.

Given that finding a pattern seems difficult, perhaps we can model the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b] using a recursive function that computes the sum, leveraging memoization.

But even this is challenging.

Another idea: For the sum from a to b, split it into the sum of even and odd k's. For even k, k=2m, and for odd k=2m+1. Then, the sum can be expressed recursively.

But this also may not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed using the binary representation of the range [a, b], and for each bit, determine how many times it's set in the sum.

But again, this requires understanding the structure of f(k), which is unclear.

Given the time constraints and the difficulty of finding a pattern, perhaps the only way to proceed is to use memoization for f(k) and compute the sum for each k in the required ranges by calling f(k) for each k and accumulating the sum. However, this approach would be feasible only if the number of k's per query is small.

But for a query that requires summing from k=1e18 to k=1e18, this is manageable. But for a query that requires summing from k=1 to k=1e18, this approach is impossible.

So, this suggests that the problem requires a different approach.

Another observation: The value of a_m for m>n is determined by the path of divisions by 2 until reaching a value <=n. So for each m>n, a_m is the XOR of the cumulative XOR up to some k <=n.

Wait, for example:

Consider m=100, which is greater than n. To compute a_100, we need to compute f(50). To compute f(50), if 50>n, we need to compute f(49) XOR f(25), and so on until we reach a k <=n.

So, for m>n, a_m is determined by the XOR of a chain of f(k) values until reaching k <=n. But how?

Let's consider this chain for a particular k.

For example, let's take k= 100 (n=50, so k>n).

f(100) = f(99) XOR f(50).

But f(99) = f(98) XOR f(49), and f(50) = f(49) XOR f(25).

So f(100) = (f(98) XOR f(49)) XOR (f(49) XOR f(25)).

XOR is associative and commutative, and XORing a number with itself cancels it. So this becomes f(98) XOR f(25).

So f(100) = f(98) XOR f(25).

But this seems to be getting us somewhere. Perhaps the recursion can be simplified by canceling terms.

But this requires a deeper analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps for even and odd k:

For even k=2m:

f(2m) = f(2m-1) XOR f(m).

But f(2m-1) = f(2m-2) XOR f(m-1).

So f(2m) = (f(2m-2) XOR f(m-1)) XOR f(m).

Similarly, for odd k=2m+1:

f(2m+1) = f(2m) XOR f(m).

But this seems to create a recursive structure that may allow for some cancellation or pattern.

But even this, I'm not sure.

Another approach: Since XOR is associative and commutative, the order of operations does not matter. So perhaps the function f(k) can be expressed as the XOR of certain terms along the path of divisions by 2 until reaching a k <=n.

For example, for a given k>n:

f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2)

But f(k-1) can also be expressed as f(k-2) XOR f((k-1)//2).

So recursively substituting, perhaps f(k) is the XOR of a sequence of terms.

But this is getting complicated.

Let me try for k=4, n=1:

f(4) = f(3) XOR f(2)

f(3) = f(2) XOR f(1)

f(2) = f(1) XOR f(1) =0

So f(3) =0 XOR1=1.

f(4)=1 XOR0=1.

But f(4) can be written as ( (f(1) XOR f(1)) XOR f(1) ) XOR (f(1) XOR f(1) ) ), which is complicated.

Another example: k=5, n=1.

f(5) =f(4) XOR f(2) =1 XOR0=1.

But f(4)=1 (from above), f(2)=0.

So f(5) is 1.

But f(5) can be written as f(4) XOR f(2) = (f(3) XOR f(2)) XOR f(2) = f(3) XOR (f(2) XOR f(2)) = f(3) XOR0 =f(3) =1.

So this cancels the f(2) term.

This suggests that the recursive expansion may allow for certain terms to cancel each other out.

But this seems to depend on the parity of k and the path taken.

Perhaps there's a way to model f(k) as the XOR of a certain number of initial terms.

But I'm not seeing it.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix_xor for the initial terms, and for any query, compute the sum for the part up to n, then for the part beyond n, model the sum as sum_even + sum_odd, where sum_even is the sum of f(k) for even m's in the range and sum_odd is the sum for odd m's. Then, for each k in the even and odd ranges, compute f(k) using memoization, and sum them.

But for large ranges (like 1e18), this is impossible.

So, the only way to proceed is to find a way to compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b] efficiently, which requires finding a pattern or mathematical formula for the sum.

But given the time I've spent and not finding such a pattern, perhaps I need to look for an alternative approach.

Wait, another observation: The function f(k) is the cumulative XOR of the first k terms. XOR is a bitwise operation where the cumulative XOR up to k can be 0 or 1. So, perhaps the sum of f(k) from a to b is the number of times the cumulative XOR is 1 in that range.

But how does the cumulative XOR behave?

For the initial terms, the prefix_xor is known. For terms beyond n, the prefix_xor is built recursively.

But the cumulative XOR could have a pattern. For example, it might alternate between 0 and 1, but that's not necessarily the case.

But if we can compute the cumulative XOR up to k terms, then the sum is the count of 1's in the range.

But again, this requires a way to compute the count of 1's in the prefix_xor array from a to b.

But how?

Perhaps the sum of f(k) from a to b is the count of 1's in the prefix_xor array from a to b. But this is only true if the prefix_xor array is the same as the f(k) array, which it is.

But for k >n, f(k) is computed as the cumulative XOR of the first k terms, which includes the initial terms and the generated terms.

But this seems to be a dead end.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern or a way to represent f(k) in terms of the binary representation of k.

Let me think of f(k) for k> n as a function that depends on the path from k to some base case (k <=n) by repeatedly subtracting 1 and dividing by 2.

For example, to compute f(100), we need f(99) and f(50). To compute f(99), we need f(98) and f(49), and so on.

This forms a tree-like structure where each node has two children: k-1 and k//2.

But for large k, this tree becomes very deep, but perhaps the number of unique nodes visited is logarithmic.

So, using memoization, we can compute f(k) for each k in the sum.

But for a query that requires summing f(k) for k from a to b, where a and b are up to 1e18, this approach is not feasible.

Thus, the problem seems to require a different insight.

Another possible insight: For m>n, the value of a_m depends on the parity of the number of times you divide m by 2 until you reach a value <=n. Or perhaps the value of a_m is determined by the parity of the number of set bits in the binary representation of m.

But this is a shot in the dark.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the binary representation of m. For example, each time you divide m by 2, you are right-shifting the binary representation. So, for m>n, the value of a_m is determined by the path of right shifts until you reach a value <=n. The cumulative XOR along this path determines the value of a_m.

But how to model this.

For example, m= 100 (binary 1100100). Let's say n=50.

Then, floor(100/2) =50. If 50>n, then a_m is prefix_xor[50]. But 50> n? No, in this case n=50, so 50 is not greater than n. So a_100 is prefix_xor[50].

So if n=50, a_100 is prefix_xor[50], which is known.

But if n=49, then 50>49, so a_100 is prefix_xor[50], which is f(50). f(50) is computed as f(49) XOR f(25).

But f(49) is f(48) XOR f(24).

And so on until we reach a k <=n.

So for each m>n, a_m is determined by the path of k's obtained by floor(m/2) until k <=n. Then, a_m is the XOR of all the prefix_xor's of those k's.

Wait, no. Because a_m is equal to the prefix_xor of floor(m/2), which is f(k), where k = floor(m/2).

But f(k) is the cumulative XOR up to k. So, for each k in the path, we need to compute f(k) recursively until k <=n.

But this seems like the same problem as before.

So, the only way to compute a_m is to compute f(k) where k is floor(m/2), and to compute f(k) recursively until k <=n.

But this suggests that for each a_m in the query range, the computation of a_m involves a chain of O(log m) steps.

Given that the query range can have up to 1e18 terms, this approach is not feasible.

Thus, the problem requires a different approach that I'm not seeing.

At this point, I think I need to refer to the problem's hints or think of the solution in terms of memoizing the sum of f(k) over certain ranges.

But I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use memoization for f(k) and compute the sum of f(k) for the required ranges, accepting that for large ranges, this will be too slow. But given the sample input and outputs, perhaps the sum can be computed using memoization and some smart precomputed patterns.

Alternatively, the key is to realize that for k >n, the function f(k) can be represented as the XOR of the prefix_xor of the initial n terms and the sum of certain other terms. But I'm not sure.

Another possible observation: Since each a_m for m>n is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) terms, the sequence a_m can be viewed as the cumulative XOR up to that point. So, the sequence a_m for m>n is determined by the cumulative XOR of the prefix of the sequence up to floor(m/2). This might lead to a pattern where the sequence repeats or has a certain structure based on the initial terms.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and not making progress, I think the correct approach is to use memoization with recursion to compute f(k) for each required k, and then sum the counts for the even and odd m's in the query range.

But given the time constraints, this approach may not pass for large ranges. However, given that the problem allows for up to 2 seconds per test case, and the fact that each f(k) computation is O(log k) time due to the memoization, and the number of k's per query is O(1) (since the sum is split into even and odd ranges), perhaps it's manageable.

So the steps are:

For each test case:

1. Precompute the prefix_xor array up to n.

2. For the query l to r:

   a. Compute the sum of the initial terms in the range [l, min(r, n)].

   b. For the remaining part (m >n), compute the even and odd ranges, and sum the corresponding f(k) values.

   c. Sum these parts and output the total.

The key challenge is to compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b] efficiently using memoization.

Thus, the code will look something like this:

- Precompute prefix_xor for the initial n terms.

- Define a memoization dictionary (like a cache) for f(k).

- For a given k:

   if k <=n:

       return prefix_xor[k]

   else:

       if k in memo:

           return memo[k]

       res = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2)

       memo[k] = res

       return res

But for large k, this is only feasible if the number of unique k's is manageable.

For the sum of f(k) from a to b, the code would need to iterate from a to b and compute each f(k), which is O( (b-a+1) * log k ) time. Which is not feasible for large ranges.

But the sample input includes cases where the sum is computed for ranges up to 1e18. So this approach is not feasible.

Thus, there must be a different approach.

Another observation: The function f(k) can be represented as the XOR of the bits in the binary representation of k. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for k >n, the value of f(k) depends on the parity of the number of ones in the binary representation of (k -n). But this is a shot in the dark.

Alternatively, perhaps f(k) follows the same pattern as the initial prefix_xor. For example, if the initial prefix_xor is periodic, then the generated sequence will also be periodic.

But again, this requires the initial prefix_xor to have a certain structure.

Given the time I've spent and not finding a solution, I think I need to look for patterns or mathematical properties that I'm missing.

Wait, another idea: For k >n, the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2). This is similar to a binary Gray code sequence, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this recurrence is similar to the Thue-Morse sequence, which is generated by the number of ones in the binary representation of k. But again, I'm not sure.

The Thue-Morse sequence has a recurrence where each term is the parity of the number of ones in the binary representation of the index. But this may not be directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a connection between f(k) and the parity of the number of times we take k//2 until we reach a certain value.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to look for a different way to model the problem.

Final idea: Let's consider that for each k, the value of f(k) is determined by the parity of the number of times we reach a certain point in the recursive chain. For example, each time we compute f(k), we may alternate between 0 and 1 based on the number of steps in the recursion. But this is a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(k) can be represented as the XOR of all the initial prefix_xor values encountered along the path of divisions by 2.

For example, for k = 100 and n=50:

k=100 → floor(100/2) =50 → 50 <=n. So f(100) = f(99) XOR f(50).

f(99) = f(98) XOR f(49).

f(98) = f(97) XOR f(49).

...

This seems to chain down until reaching a k <=n.

But each step involves a new recursive call. The number of steps is O(log k), but the actual value of f(k) depends on the parity of the number of times each initial prefix_xor is included.

But this is getting too vague.

Given the time I've spent and not finding a solution, I think the correct approach is to use memoization and compute the sum for the required ranges, and hope that the constraints are manageable.

But for ranges up to 1e18, this is impossible.

Thus, the problem must have a pattern that allows for the sum to be computed in O(log k) time per query.

But I'm unable to find this pattern.

After struggling for a long time, I think I need to look for hints from the problem's sample input and note.

For example, in the first sample, the sum is 1 because l and r are 1. In the second sample, the sum is 5 for a range from 3 to 10.

Looking at the generated sequence for the second sample (n=2, a_1=1, a_2=0):

The sequence for m>2 is:

a_3 = XOR of first 1 elements (prefix_xor[1]=1)

a_4 = XOR of first 2 elements (prefix_xor[2]=1^0=1)

a_5 = XOR of first 2 elements (same as a_4)

a_6 = XOR of first 3 elements (1^0^1=0)

a_7 = XOR of first 3 elements (0)

a_8 = XOR of first 4 elements (1^0^1^1=1)

a_9 = XOR of first 4 elements (1)

a_10 = XOR of first 5 elements (1^0^1^1^1=0)

So the sum from 3 to 10 is 1+1+1+0+0+1+1+0 =5.

But how to compute this quickly.

Another observation: Each term a_m for m>n is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) terms. So, for even and odd m, the floor(m/2) is either k or k.

For example, m=2k and 2k+1 share the same k.

Thus, for even and odd m's with the same k, their a_m values are both f(k). So for each k, two terms contribute 2*f(k) to the sum.

But this is only true if both 2k and 2k+1 are in the range.

Thus, the sum can be split into pairs of terms and individual terms.

But again, how to compute this for large ranges.

Finally, the answer must involve a recursive function that computes the sum of f(k) for a given range, using the fact that f(k) depends on f(k-1) and f(k//2), and memoizing the results.

But due to time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach:

Implement a memoization-based function to compute f(k), and then compute the sum for the even and odd ranges by iterating through each k in the required ranges and summing f(k).

But for large ranges, this approach is not feasible. However, given the problem's sample input and the fact that the sum for each query can be computed by breaking into even and odd terms, perhaps there's a way to model this recursively.

But I'm out of time and must provide an answer.
