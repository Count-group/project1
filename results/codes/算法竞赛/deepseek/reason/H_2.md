Okay, let's see. The user says that their code doesn't pass the sample input. Let's look at the sample input and output again.

The sample input is:
5
3 1 5 4 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5

The sample output is:
3 1 5 4 2

But according to the previous code, which just outputs the permutation p as the answer, in this case, that's exactly what the sample output is. So why is there a problem here? Wait, perhaps the code is correct for the sample, but maybe other cases where the tree structure affects the placement. Oh right, the initial approach assumed that the given permutation can be directly outputted because of the depth constraints. But maybe that's not the case. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says that when you throw a ball (say ball i) into the tree, you start at vertex 1. Then, for each step, if the current vertex p (which is the p_i of the ball) is already filled, you must choose a son x of p such that x's subtree has at least one empty spot. Then the ball moves to x and repeats. The goal is to assign the balls in such a way that the resulting a array is lex smallest possible.

But the initial code just outputs p as the answer. However, in the sample input, the output is exactly the permutation p, which suggests that in that case, each ball i is placed exactly in node i. But how does that happen? Let's think through the sample.

Sample input's permutation is [3,1,5,4,2]. So for each ball:

Ball 1: p_i is 3. So we start at node 1. Then check if node 3 is filled. Since it's the first ball, node 3 is empty. So ball 1 is placed at node 3. a[3] =3.

Ball 2: p_i is 1. Start at node 1. Is node 1 filled? No. So ball 2 is placed there. a[1] =1.

Ball 3: p_i is 5. Start at node 1. Then check node 5. Since node 1's subtree (the entire tree) is node 1,2,3,4,5. But node 5 is in node 4's subtree, right? The tree structure in the sample is 1-2-3-4-5. So node 5 is a leaf. When placing ball 3, which has p_i=5, we start at node 1, check node 5. Since node 5 is empty, place there. a[5] =5.

Ball 4: p_i is4. Check node4. It's empty, so place there. a[4]=4.

Ball5: p_i is2. Check node2. Is it filled? No. So a[2]=2.

So the a array is [1,2,3,4,5], but the sample output is [3,1,5,4,2]. Wait, that's not matching. Wait no, the a array is the value of the ball in each node. So for the sample input, the balls are placed as follows:

a_1 is the value of the ball placed in node1. According to the steps:

Ball1 is placed in node3. So a_3 is 3.

Ball2 is placed in node1. a_1 is1.

Ball3 is placed in node5. a_5 is5.

Ball4 in node4: a_4 is4.

Ball5 in node2: a_2 is2.

So the a array is [1,2,3,4,5] at positions 1-5? No, wait a_i is the value in the i-th vertex.

So node1 has value1 (from ball2), node2 has value2 (ball5), node3 has3 (ball1), node4 has4 (ball4), node5 has5 (ball3). So the a array is [1,2,3,4,5], but the sample output is [3,1,5,4,2]. Wait, that's conflicting. So the sample output must be the a array in the order of the nodes. Let's see:

Sample output is 3 1 5 4 2. So a_1=3? That can't be right according to the previous reasoning.

Wait no, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The problem says: after throwing all the balls, a_i is the value of the ball in the i-th vertex. So for the sample input, the output is 3 1 5 4 2. So node1 has value3, node2 has value1, etc. How does that happen?

Wait let's retrace the steps for each ball.

Ball1 has p_i=3. So the process is:

1. Throw into vertex1 (step1).
2. The current vertex is p=3 (step2).
3. Check if vertex3 is filled. It's not. So place the ball (ball1) there. a_3=3.

Ball2: p_i=1. So:

1. Start at vertex1 (step1).
2. p=1 (ball2's p_i is1).
3. Is vertex1 filled? No. Place ball2 there. a_1=1.

Ball3: p_i=5.

1. Throw into vertex1.
2. p=5. Check vertex5. Is it filled? No. So place ball3 there. a_5=5.

Ball4: p_i=4.

1. Start at vertex1. p=4. Check if vertex4 is filled? No. Place ball4 there. a_4=4.

Ball5: p_i=2.

1. Throw into vertex1. p=2. Check vertex2. Not filled. Place ball5 there. a_2=2.

So the a array is:

a_1 =1 (from ball2)
a_2=2 (ball5)
a_3=3 (ball1)
a_4=4 (ball4)
a_5=5 (ball3)

But the sample output is 3 1 5 4 2. Which suggests that a_1 is3, a_2 is1, a_3 is5, etc. So that's conflicting with the previous reasoning.

This indicates that my initial understanding of the problem is wrong. So where is the mistake?

Ah, perhaps the process of placing the ball is not as straightforward as going directly to p_i. Let's re-examine the steps.

When you throw the ball, the steps are:

1. Throw into vertex1.

Wait step1 says "Throw the ball into vertex1". Then step2 says, "Let the vertex where the ball is be p". Wait, perhaps the p here is p_i, but maybe I misunderstood.

Wait the steps are:

Each ball is processed in order 1 to n. For each ball:

Step1: Throw into vertex1. So current vertex is 1.

Step2: Let p be the p_i of the current ball. Then, check if the p-th vertex is filled.

Wait, no. Wait, the steps are:

For each ball, when you throw it, the process is:

1. Start at vertex1.

2. Let the current vertex where the ball is be p. Wait, perhaps I misread this. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says:

For each ball i, you perform the following steps:

1. Throw the ball into vertex1.

So the ball starts at vertex1.

2. Let the vertex where the ball is be p. Then, check if p-th vertex is filled.

Wait no. The ball is at vertex1, but the problem says that in step 2, p is the current vertex (vertex1) but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the problem's step2 says:

"Let the vertex where the ball is be p."

Wait, the ball is currently at a vertex (after being thrown into vertex1, then possibly moved). So for step2, the current vertex is p. Then, check if the p-th vertex has been filled. Wait, no. The p here is the current vertex where the ball is. So the process is:

After throwing the ball into vertex1 (step1), the current position is vertex1. So step2: p is 1. Then check if vertex1 is filled. If it's not, place the ball there. If it is filled, then you need to choose a child x of vertex1 that has at least one empty spot in its subtree, and move the ball to x, then repeat step2 with x as the new p.

Wait, that's a different approach. So the process is not to go to the p_i-th vertex directly. Instead, the ball starts at vertex1, and then each time checks if the current vertex (p) is filled. If not, stays there. If filled, must choose a child of p where the subtree has space.

Wait, this is a completely different approach. So the p in step2 is the current vertex where the ball is, not the p_i of the ball. Then how does the ball's p_i come into play?

Oh wait, perhaps I completely misread the problem. Let's re-express the problem's steps.

The steps for each ball are:

1. Throw into vertex1.

2. Let the current vertex be p (initially 1).

3. If the p-th vertex is already filled with another ball, you need to choose a child x of p such that x's subtree has at least one empty vertex. Then, move to x, set p = x, and repeat step3.

4. If the p-th vertex is not filled, then place the ball there.

So the process is that the ball starts at the root (vertex1). Then, at each step, if the current vertex is filled, it must choose a child whose subtree still has space and move there. This continues until it finds a vertex that is empty, where it places the ball.

But how does the p_i of the ball relate to this process? Wait, the problem statement says that p_i is the ball's value. Wait, the problem says: "the i-th ball's value is p_i". So the ball's value is p_i, which is part of a permutation. The process for placing the ball is as described, and the a array is the values of the balls in the vertices.

But the actual placement process is about the path the ball takes through the tree, starting at the root, and moving down through children as needed until finding an empty spot. The p_i is not directly part of this process. So the problem is: when placing each ball (in order 1 to n), the ball's value is p_i, but the process of where it is placed depends on the tree's structure and previous placements.

Wait, this is a critical misunderstanding. So the problem's steps are about the placement of the ball, which is determined by moving down the tree until finding an empty node. The p_i is the value of the ball, but the placement is determined by the tree structure and the order of placement. The goal is to assign the balls to nodes such that, when processed in order 1 to n, each ball is placed in the earliest possible position (lex order) by the process described.

The lex smallest a array is achieved by ensuring that, for each node, the ball placed there is the smallest possible value in that node, given the constraints of the process.

Wait, but how? Because the placement process is fixed for each ball. The ball i must start at the root and move down as per the steps. So for each ball, the path it takes is determined by which nodes are already filled.

So the key is to model where each ball is placed, given the order in which balls are processed (1 to n), and the tree structure.

The goal is to find the lex smallest a array. Lex order is determined by a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. To minimize lex order, we want a_1 to be as small as possible, then a_2 as small as possible given a_1, etc.

But the problem states that the balls are processed in order 1 to n. So ball 1 is placed first, then ball 2, etc. Each ball is placed according to the process, which depends on the tree and previously placed balls.

The challenge is to find how the balls are placed, given their processing order, and then output the a array.

But the initial code assumed that the a array is the permutation p. However, in the sample input, the a array is [3,1,5,4,2], which matches the permutation p. But according to the correct process, perhaps the code should not output p as is. So how does the sample input's a array match p?

Wait, in the sample input, the permutation p is [3,1,5,4,2]. So ball1 has value3, ball2 value1, etc. The a array is [3,1,5,4,2], which suggests that node1 has value3 (ball1), node2 has value1 (ball2), node3 has5 (ball3), node4 has4 (ball4), and node5 has2 (ball5). But according to the process, this can't be correct.

Let's re-examine the sample.

Sample Input:

n=5.

p = [3,1,5,4,2]

Tree edges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4,4-5. So the tree is a straight line: 1 is root, 2 is child of 1, 3 child of 2, etc.

Processing the balls in order 1 to 5.

Ball 1 (value3):

Starts at node1. Check if node1 is filled (it's empty). So ball1 is placed in node1. So a_1=3.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because the first ball is placed into node1.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the process steps again:

For ball1:

1. Throw into vertex1.

2. Current vertex is p=1.

3. Check if p (vertex1) is filled. Initially, no. So place the ball here. So a[1] =3.

Ball2 (value1):

Starts at vertex1. Check if it's filled (yes, it's occupied by ball1). So need to choose a child x of 1 (which is 2) whose subtree has at least one empty spot.

So move to x=2. Check if vertex2 is filled. No. So place here. a[2]=1.

Ball3 (value5):

Starts at vertex1. It's filled. Choose child 2. Check if 2 is filled (yes). Move to child of 2, which is3. Check if3 is filled. No. Place here. a[3]=5.

Ball4 (value4):

Starts at vertex1. Filled. Go to 2. Filled. Go to3. Filled. Go to4. Check if4 is filled. No. Place here. a[4]=4.

Ball5 (value2):

Starts at1. Filled. Go to2. Filled. Go to3. Filled. Go to4. Filled. Go to5. Check if5 is filled. No. Place here. a[5]=2.

Thus, the a array is [3,1,5,4,2], which matches the sample output.

So the initial approach of outputting p is correct for the sample. But why? Because the order in which the balls are placed is such that the first ball is placed in node1 (since it's empty), and subsequent balls are pushed down the tree.

But the permutation p is the sequence of ball values. So ball1's value is3, ball2 is1, etc. So the a array ends up as [3,1,5,4,2], which is exactly the p array. So why does this happen?

Because the tree is a straight line, and each ball is placed in the first available node along the path. The first ball (ball1) is placed at1. Ball2 can't be placed at1, so goes to2. Ball3 goes to3, etc. So the nodes 1 to5 are filled in order by balls1 to5. Since ball i is placed in node i, and their values are p_i, the a array is p_1 in node1, p_2 in node2, etc. So a[i] = p_i.

But how does this relate to the tree's structure? The sample's tree is a chain. But for other trees, the placement might not be in order. So the initial approach of outputting p as the answer is correct only when the tree is a chain and nodes are filled in order. But in other trees, the nodes may be filled in a different order.

For example, consider a tree where node1 has two children, node2 and node3. Suppose the balls are placed such that ball1 goes to node1, ball2 to node2, ball3 to node3. Then a array would be [p1, p2, p3, ...]. But if the tree is such that after node1 is filled, the next balls are placed in node2 and node3 in some order.

So the initial code that outputs p is only correct when the nodes are filled in the order of their indices. But according to the problem's constraints, for any two vertices x < y, dep_x ≤ dep_y. Which means that nodes are ordered such that lower-numbered nodes are not deeper than higher-numbered nodes. But how does this affect the placement?

The tree's structure has the nodes ordered such that node x has a depth less than or equal to node y if x < y. So nodes are arranged in such a way that lower indices are in the same or higher levels than higher indices.

This could mean that when placing balls in order 1 to n, each ball is placed in the earliest possible node (in index order) in the tree. Because when processing ball i, the process of moving down the tree will prefer nodes with lower indices first. Because when a node has multiple children, the choice of which child to go to must be made to select the one with the earliest possible placement (to minimize lex order). 

Wait, the problem says that when you have to choose a child x of p, you can choose any child whose subtree has an empty spot. But to minimize the lex order of the a array, we need to choose the child x with the smallest possible index. Because filling lower-numbered nodes with smaller values (since balls are processed in order and the lex order is determined by the a array) may lead to a smaller lex order.

Wait, no. The lex order is determined by the a array. To minimize the lex order, we want the earliest positions (nodes) to have the smallest possible values. So when placing a ball, if the ball's value is small, we want to place it in as early a node as possible.

But the balls are processed in order 1 to n. So ball1 is placed first, then ball2, etc. Each ball's value is p_i. So to minimize the lex order, for each ball, we want to place it in the earliest possible (smallest index) node that is available.

Thus, the process of placing each ball in the earliest available node (smallest index) would lead to the lex smallest a array. 

But how does the tree's structure and the placement rules allow this?

Given that when a ball is placed, it starts at the root and moves down the tree until it finds an empty node. When a node is filled, the next balls have to go deeper. But the choice of which child to choose (when a node has multiple children) would affect which node is filled next.

If, when a node has multiple children, the algorithm always chooses the child with the smallest index (thus leading to filling lower-indexed nodes first), then the nodes would be filled in order of their indices, and the a array would be p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. 

Because the problem's constraint says that for any x < y, dep_x ≤ dep_y, which implies that a node with a smaller index is not deeper than a node with a larger index. So in a tree where nodes are ordered such that lower-indexed nodes are at the same or higher depth, the available nodes for placement are filled in index order. 

Thus, the process of placing each ball in the earliest possible node (smallest index available) would lead to the a array being exactly the permutation p. Because ball1 is placed in node1, ball2 in node2 (if node1 is filled), etc.

But how does this hold in the sample? Because in the sample, the nodes are filled in order 1,2,3,4,5. But the sample's a array is [3,1,5,4,2], which is the p array. Wait, that's because the balls are placed in nodes 1 to5, but their values are p_i. So a_1 is p_1, a_2 is p_2, etc. But the sample shows that a_1 is3 (p_1), a_2 is1 (p_2), and so on. So yes, the a array is the p array.

Thus, the initial code that outputs p is correct. But why does the sample's a array match p? Because each ball is placed in the node corresponding to its order of processing. Ball i is placed in node i. So a_i = p_i.

But how can this be? Because the tree's structure and the placement rules ensure that each ball is placed in the next available node in index order.

But how? Let's see:

Assuming that the tree is structured such that node1 has children node2, node3, ..., and so on. And the depth constraint ensures that lower-numbered nodes are higher up. When a ball is processed, it starts at node1, which is filled, so moves to its first child (smallest index), which is available.

But how can node2 be filled after node1? Because the first ball is placed in node1. The second ball starts at node1, which is filled. So it moves to the first child of node1 (node2). If node2 is empty, the second ball is placed there. Then third ball starts at node1, filled, moves to node2, filled, then moves to node3 (child of node2), and so on.

Thus, the nodes are filled in the order of their indices. So ball i is placed in node i. Hence, the a array is exactly the permutation p.

Therefore, the correct approach is to output the p array directly. 

But then why did the user say that the code doesn't pass all samples? Perhaps the sample I'm looking at is correct, but there are other test cases where the tree structure doesn't allow this. Wait, the problem's constraint says that for any x < y, dep_x <= dep_y. This ensures that the nodes are ordered in such a way that lower-numbered nodes are not deeper than higher-numbered ones. Thus, the tree is structured such that nodes are arranged in BFS order or something similar, ensuring that when you process the nodes in order 1 to n, each ball is placed in the next available node in the same order.

Thus, the initial code is correct. But why does the sample have a output that matches the p array? Because the initial code's logic is correct.

But the user says that the code doesn't pass all samples. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let's think of another test case.

Test case 1:

n=3.

p = [2,3,1]

Tree edges:

1-2

1-3

So the tree is root 1 with children 2 and 3.

For this tree, the depth of each node is:

dep_1 =1, dep_2=2, dep_3=2.

Now processing balls:

Ball1 (p=2):

Starts at1. 1 is empty. Place here. a_1=2.

Ball2 (p=3):

Starts at1. Filled. Choose a child (2 or3). According to the problem's steps, when choosing a child x, you need to select one where the subtree has an empty spot. For ball2, the available children are 2 and3. Which one to choose? To minimize lex order, we should choose the smallest possible x. So x=2. Check if subtree of2 (which is only node2) is empty. Yes. So move to2. Place ball2 here. a_2=3.

Ball3 (p=1):

Starts at1. Filled. Choose between children2 and3. Child2 is filled (ball2 is there). So go to child3. Place here. a_3=1.

Thus, the a array is [2,3,1], which is the p array. So the code's output is correct.

Another test case:

n=4.

p = [4,3,2,1]

Tree structure:

1 is root, with children 2 and3. Node3 has child4.

Nodes' depths:

1:1, 2:2,3:2,4:3.

Balls processed in order:

Ball1 (p=4):

Place in node1. a_1=4.

Ball2 (p=3):

Starts at1 (filled). Children are2 and3. Choose x=2. Check if subtree of2 has space. Yes. Move to2. Place here. a_2=3.

Ball3 (p=2):

Starts at1 (filled). Children 2 is filled, 3 is available. Move to3. Check if3 is filled. No. Place here. a_3=2.

Ball4 (p=1):

Starts at1 (filled). Children are2 (filled) and3 (filled). So must choose a child of3. Node3's children are4. Check if4 is empty. Yes. Move to4. Place here. a_4=1.

Thus, the a array is [4,3,2,1], which is the p array. So the code's output is correct.

Thus, the initial approach seems to be correct. The sample input passes, and other test cases also align. So why did the user mention that the code does not pass all samples? Perhaps there's a misunderstanding, but according to the analysis, the code is correct.

But perhaps the problem requires that when there are multiple possible choices for x (children of p with available subtree), you have to choose the child with the smallest index. Because if you choose a larger index, it could lead to a different a array. 

Let's see another example. Suppose the tree is:

n=3.

p = [3,1,2].

Tree edges:

1-2, 1-3.

Ball1: placed in1. a_1=3.

Ball2: starts at1 (filled). Choose between children2 and3. To minimize lex order, we want the earliest possible node. So choose2. Place here. a_2=1.

Ball3: starts at1 (filled). Children2 is filled, so choose3. Place here. a_3=2.

a array is [3,1,2], which is p. Correct.

But what if the code outputs p, but in a scenario where the placement does not follow node order?

Another example: n=3.

p = [1,2,3].

Tree: 1 is root, children 3 and 2 (nodes are ordered in the tree such that 3 is a child of1, 2 is also a child of1, but in the edge list, the order might not matter).

But according to the problem's constraint, x<y implies dep_x ≤ dep_y. So node2 has dep=2, node3 has dep=2. So in the tree, 1 has children 2 and3. But since node2<3, the code can assume that node2 is processed first.

But when processing ball2:

Ball1 (p=1): placed in node1. a_1=1.

Ball2 (p=2): starts at1 (filled). Children are2 and3. To choose which child to move to, we pick the smallest x (2). Place here. a_2=2.

Ball3 (p=3): starts at1 (filled). Children2 is filled. So move to3. Place here. a_3=3.

The a array is [1,2,3], which is p.

Thus, regardless of the tree's structure (as long as the depth constraint is met), the code's approach of outputting p is correct.

Thus, the initial code is correct. But perhaps the user made a mistake in testing or there's a misunderstanding. So the correct code is to output the permutation p.
