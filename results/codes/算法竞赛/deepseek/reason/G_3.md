Okay, I need to make this code even more efficient. Let's see. The problem is handling a graph with up to 3 million edges and 2 million queries. The key is the degeneracy order, which ensures each node has at most 10 outgoing edges. So the main operations are updates and queries on adjacent nodes.

First, let's look at the existing code. The degeneracy order is computed using a bucket method. But maybe that can be optimized. The original code uses vectors of vectors for adjacency lists, which is standard. But when building the outgoing edges, perhaps using a more efficient data structure would help. Wait, but in C++, vectors are already pretty efficient. However, maybe the way we process the adjacency lists can be improved.

Wait, the core decomposition (degeneracy order) part might have some inefficiencies. Let me check that function. The original code uses a vector of vectors for bins, and tracks positions. Maybe using a linked list approach for the bins could be faster, but that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe using a priority queue with a smart way to handle degrees. But the current approach is O(n) time, which is acceptable. Hmm.

Another point: in the main loop after the order is computed, when building outgoing edges, it checks if pos[u] > pos[v]. Since the order is determined by the core decomposition, perhaps pre-sorting the adjacency list for each node based on the pos array would allow faster iteration. Wait, but for each u, we have to check all its neighbors, and include those with pos[v] < pos[u]. Since the outgoing edges are determined by the order, maybe pre-sorting isn't necessary, but perhaps during the initial processing of adj[u], we can store the neighbors in a way that allows faster iteration. But I don't think that's possible without knowing the order beforehand.

Another area to optimize is the data structures. For the sum_in and a arrays, using long long is necessary. But maybe using arrays instead of vectors could be faster. However, in C++, vectors are as efficient as arrays when using the [] operator. So probably not a big gain there.

Wait, in the compute_degeneracy_order function, the code uses a vector of vectors for bin, and for each node, when its degree is decreased, it's moved to a lower bin. The way nodes are tracked here could be optimized. The original code uses a pos array to track the position of each node in its current bin. But when moving nodes between bins, there's a lot of swapping. Maybe using a linked list approach for each bin would be more efficient. But linked lists are not cache-friendly. Alternatively, perhaps using a more optimized data structure like a doubly linked list with indices. But this might complicate the code.

Alternatively, the existing code might be sufficient. Let's check the sample input. The sample input has n=4, m=6, which is a complete graph. The code should process that correctly. But for large n and m, the compute_degeneracy_order function's efficiency is crucial.

Another idea: using a static array for the bins. But in C++, dynamic vectors are flexible. However, resizing vectors can be expensive. But in the code, bins are resized when necessary. Maybe preallocating bins up to the maximum possible degree (which is up to n-1) but for n=3e5, that's not feasible. So probably the current approach is okay.

Let's look at the main loop. After the order is computed, the outgoing edges are built by checking each neighbor. For each u, outgoing[u] contains all v where pos[u] > pos[v]. The size of outgoing[u] is at most 10. So during the queries, when handling a type 2 operation, we loop over outgoing[x] (up to 10 elements) and sum a[u]. That's O(10) time per query, which is acceptable.

For updates (type 1), when a node x gets v added to its a[x], we need to add v to sum_in for all outgoing[x] (again, up to 10 nodes). So that's O(10) per update. The sum_in array is maintained incrementally.

Wait, but in the original code, sum_in is built by iterating each outgoing edge of u, and adding a[u] to sum_in[v]. Then, when a[x] is updated, we iterate outgoing[x] (which are the nodes that have x as an outgoing edge, i.e., v in outgoing[x] are nodes that x points to, so in their incoming edges, x is part of their sum_in. So when x's a[x] increases, we need to add v to each of their sum_in. Wait, no. Wait, outgoing[x] contains all the nodes that x points to (i.e., v where pos[x] > pos[v], so sum_in[v] includes a[x]. Therefore, when x's a[x] increases by v, each of these sum_in[v] needs to increase by v. So the code is correct.

So the main steps are:

1. Compute the degeneracy order.

2. Build outgoing edges for each node (those with higher pos in the order).

3. Precompute sum_in for each node as the sum of a[u] for u in their incoming edges (i.e., those nodes with higher pos that point to them).

4. For updates, add to a[x] and propagate to sum_in of outgoing[x] nodes.

5. For queries, sum sum_in[x] (incoming) and sum the a[u] of outgoing[x] nodes (outgoing edges from x to lower pos nodes).

The main optimizations would be in the compute_degeneracy_order function, which is O(n + m), and in the data structures for handling edges and updates.

Another possible optimization is to use fast I/O. The original code uses scanf and printf, which are faster than cin/cout. But maybe using getchar_unlocked or other faster methods could help. However, the code already uses scanf and printf, which are reasonably fast.

Wait, in the original code, the a array is read as %lld, but in C++, long long uses %lld. But the problem states a_i can be up to 100 initially, and each v is up to 100, but after q updates, the sum could be up to 1e7 (100 + 2e6 * 100 = 2e8). So using long long is correct.

Another possible optimization is to precompute the outgoing edges as a list of pointers or indices, but in C++ vectors are efficient for iteration.

Wait, perhaps the outgoing vectors can be stored as a single contiguous array, but for each node, it's a small number of elements (up to 10), so it's better to have a vector per node.

Another idea: when building outgoing edges, since each edge is processed twice (u to v and v to u), but only one direction is kept. However, the code correctly checks pos[u] > pos[v] to determine the direction.

Alternatively, during the initial building of outgoing edges, perhaps we can avoid processing all edges. Wait, no. Because for each edge (u, v), we have to check which direction it goes based on the pos array. So for each edge, both directions are checked once.

Another area for optimization: the pos array. It's built by assigning the position in the order. So order[0] is the first node in the degeneracy order, and pos[order[0]] = 0. So for each node u, pos[u] is its index in the order array. So for any u and v, if pos[u] > pos[v], then u comes later in the order than v.

Now, during the outgoing edge construction, for each u, iterate through all its neighbors and check if pos[u] > pos[v]. So for each neighbor, we have to do a lookup in the pos array. Since pos is a vector of size n, this is O(1) time. But perhaps cache locality can be improved. However, for large n, the pos array may not fit into cache, leading to cache misses. But given that each node has up to 10 outgoing edges, it's manageable.

Alternatively, during the degeneracy order computation, we can precompute the outgoing edges. But I don't see how to do that.

Another possible optimization: using a structure of arrays (SoA) instead of arrays of structures (AoS), but in this case, the data is stored in vectors, which are contiguous and cache-efficient.

Wait, in the main function, after building outgoing, for each u, we process all v in adj[u], check if pos[u] > pos[v], and if so, add to outgoing[u]. But adj[u] is the original adjacency list, which contains all neighbors. For each u, this loop runs O(degree(u)) times, which for m=3e6 edges, would take O(m) time. But m is 3e6, which is acceptable.

Another thing: when building the sum_in array, for each u, iterate over outgoing[u] (each v) and add a[u] to sum_in[v]. This is O(m) time, since each edge is processed once (in the direction that's stored in outgoing). Since each edge is part of outgoing for exactly one of u or v, this loop is O(m) time. But with m up to 3e6, it's manageable.

Now, considering the queries. For each type 2 query, we need to compute the sum of a[u] for u in outgoing[x], plus sum_in[x]. Since outgoing[x] has up to 10 elements, this loop is fast.

So where can we optimize further?

Possible optimizations:

1. Replace the vector<unordered_set<int>> in the original code's compute_degeneracy_order with a more efficient structure. Wait, in the current code (the regenerated code), the compute_degeneracy_order uses a bin approach with vectors and positions, which is better than using unordered_sets. So the current code is already optimized there.

Wait, looking at the compute_degeneracy_order function in the latest code:

The code uses a vector of vectors called bin, where bin[d] contains the nodes with current degree d. pos[u] is the index of node u in its current bin. When a node's degree decreases, it's moved to a lower bin. This is done by swapping with the last element in the bin and popping it, then adding to the new bin. This is O(1) per move, which is efficient.

Yes, this is a standard linear time core decomposition approach.

Another idea: in the core decomposition, when iterating through the neighbors of u (the node being processed), perhaps using a static adjacency list with indices instead of vectors. But the current code uses a vector of vectors for adj, which is standard.

Another possible optimization: use a bitset to track processed nodes, but for n up to 3e5, a bitset would take 3e5/8 = ~37KB, which is manageable, but the current code uses a deg array where deg[u] is set to -1 when processed, which is also efficient.

So the core decomposition function is already optimized.

Now, looking at the main part after the order is computed. The code processes each edge and builds outgoing edges. This is O(m) time. Then, precomputing sum_in is O(m) as well. All manageable.

The queries and updates are handled in O(1) per operation (with constants up to 10 for the loops).

So the code is already efficient, but perhaps some micro-optimizations can be done.

Potential micro-optimizations:

1. Using a precomputed list of outgoing edges stored as a single contiguous array. For example, using a single vector for all outgoing edges and a pointer array to track the start and end for each node. But for nodes with up to 10 outgoing edges, this may not be necessary, and the overhead of managing it could outweigh the benefits.

2. Using iterators or pointers for the outgoing edges to avoid bounds checking. But in C++, vectors are accessed with [] which is unchecked, so no issue.

3. Using a more efficient way to read input. The current code uses scanf, which is fast. But perhaps using getchar_unlocked for faster reading. However, getchar_unlocked is not standard and may not be portable. Alternatively, using a custom fast input function.

For example, reading all input at once into a buffer and parsing it manually. This can significantly speed up input handling for large datasets.

Similarly for output, using a buffer to collect all outputs and then writing them at once. Since there can be up to 2e6 queries of type 2, using printf for each could be slow. Using a buffer and flushing at the end can save time.

Let me test this. For example:

In the main function, replace printf with a buffer. For example:

char outbuf[1 << 24];
int outptr = 0;

Then, when needing to output, use:

sprintf(outbuf + outptr, "%lld\n", sum_in[x] + sum_out);
outptr += strlen(outbuf + outptr);

At the end, fwrite(outbuf, 1, outptr, stdout);

This can significantly reduce the time spent on I/O.

Similarly, for input, read the entire input into a buffer once and parse it manually.

This would be a significant optimization, especially for large q.

So the code can be modified to read all input first into a buffer, then parse it, and for output, buffer all results and write them at once.

This is likely the biggest optimization possible.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read the entire input into a buffer.

2. Parse the buffer using pointers, extracting integers as needed.

3. For output, use a buffer and write all at once.

Additionally, for the a array, the initial values are read with scanf. Changing this to the custom parser.

This approach can save a lot of time, especially with 2e6 queries.

So the code's main inefficiency could be in the I/O handling.

Another possible optimization is to use a more efficient way to process the adjacency list. For example, pre-allocating the adjacency list's vectors with reserve, but given that m is known, it's possible.

In the code, adj is a vector of vectors. For m edges, each edge is added twice (since it's undirected). So adj[u].push_back(v) and adj[v].push_back(u). Each push_back can cause reallocations. Reserving space upfront can help.

For example, for each u, adj[u] will have a degree equal to the number of edges incident to u. However, in C++, we don't know the degree of each node until after processing all edges. So perhaps reading all edges first, counting the degrees, then reserving space for each adj[u]. But that requires two passes over the edges.

But with m up to 3e6, it's manageable. Let's see:

Read m edges, store them in a temporary list. Then, count the degree of each node. Then, reserve space for each adj[u]. Then, process the edges again to build the adjacency lists.

This would avoid multiple reallocations and speed up the building of the adjacency lists.

So steps:

vector<pair<int, int>> edges(m);
vector<int> degree(n, 0);
for each edge, read u and v, increment degree[u] and degree[v].

Then, for each u in 0..n-1, adj[u].reserve(degree[u]).

Then, for each edge, add u to adj[v] and v to adj[u].

This can save time by reducing the number of reallocations in the adjacency lists.

So combining these optimizations:

- Fast input parsing.

- Pre-reserving adjacency list capacities.

- Fast output buffering.

These changes can significantly improve the code's efficiency.

Now, let's implement these changes.

First, the fast input:

Read the entire input into a buffer.

Then, parse integers using a custom function.

Similarly, the output is buffered.

Additionally, pre-reserve the adjacency lists.

Let me write the code with these optimizations.

But given that the user wants the code regenerated, I'll proceed to write the code with these optimizations.
