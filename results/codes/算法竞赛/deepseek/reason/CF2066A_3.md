Okay, let's take a look at the problem again. The user mentioned that the code isn't passing all the sample test cases, so I need to figure out why. 

The problem is about determining whether the hidden object is a graph (A) or points (B) using two queries. The previous approach was to query (1,2) and (2,1) and check if either response is zero. But maybe there's a flaw in that approach.

Wait, the sample input given in the problem has two test cases. Let's look at the first sample:

First test case:
n=3
x = [2,2,3]
y is [1,3,1] (since Object A is chosen)
The queries made in the sample are 2 and 3, then 1 and 2. The outputs are 1 and 0, leading to answer A.

But in the code, the user's code is always querying 1 and 2, then 2 and 1. For the first sample, the code's approach would query (1,2) and (2,1). Let's see what the responses would be.

In the first test case's Object A (graph):
Edges are 2→1, 2→3, 3→1.

So the graph has edges:
1: x_1=2 → y_1=1 (so edge 2→1)
2: x_2=2 → y_2=3 (edge 2→3)
3: x_3=3 → y_3=1 (edge 3→1)

So, for query (1,2) (vertex 1 to vertex 2), is there a path? Let's see. Vertex 1's edges are whatever is in the array. Wait, each vertex has one outgoing edge. Wait, no: the graph is constructed with n edges, each of the form x_i → y_i. So each i contributes an edge from x_i to y_i. So each vertex can have multiple outgoing edges, depending on how many x_i's point to it.

Wait, the problem statement says that Object A is a directed graph with n edges, each x_i → y_i. So the graph is made up of these n edges. So each edge is x_i → y_i, for each i from 1 to n.

So for the first test case:

Edges are:
From x_1=2 to y_1=1: edge 2→1
x_2=2 → y_2=3: edge 2→3
x_3=3 → y_3=1: edge 3→1

So the edges are 2→1, 2→3, 3→1.

Now, for the query (1,2): asking for the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 2. But in this graph, vertex 1 has no outgoing edges. Because none of the x_i's are 1. So the path from 1 to 2 doesn't exist. So the response is 0.

Then the query (2,1): path from 2 to 1. Let's see. 2 has edges to 1 and 3. So the shortest path is 2→1, which is length 1. So response is 1.

So the code's first query would get 0 (since 1→2's path is 0), and the code would output "A", which is correct. But in the sample input, the user's code would output A correctly here.

But the second sample test case is:

n=5
x = [5,1,4,2,3]
y = [3,3,2,4,1]
Object B is the correct answer.

So the code queries (1,2) and (2,1). Let's compute Manhattan distances for these points.

For Object B, each point i is (x_i, y_i). So:

Point 1: (5,3)
Point 2: (1,3)
Point 3: (4,2)
Point 4: (2,4)
Point 5: (3,1)

Query 1 is (1,2): |5-1| + |3-3| =4+0=4. So response is 4.

Query 2 is (2,1): same as above, distance is 4. So the code sees res1=4 and res2=4, neither is zero, so outputs B. Which is correct. So the sample output would be handled correctly.

Wait, but the sample's second test case's output is "B". So the code's approach seems correct for the samples.

But maybe there's a case where the code's approach fails. Let's think of a test case where the code's approach would give the wrong answer.

Suppose we have a graph where both (1,2) and (2,1) have paths. For example, a graph where 1→2 and 2→1. Then the shortest paths for 1→2 is 1, 2→1 is 1. So the code would check res1 and res2, both non-zero, so output B. But it's actually Object A, so this would be wrong.

Ah! So this is the problem. The code's current logic assumes that if either query returns 0, then it's A. But in cases where both queries return non-zero, it's B. However, there are cases where the graph (Object A) has paths in both directions, leading to non-zero responses, which the code would mistake as Object B.

So for example, consider a test case where the graph is such that 1 and 2 form a cycle. Then both queries (1,2) and (2,1) would return 1. The code would then output B, which is wrong.

This is the flaw in the original approach. The code's logic is incorrect because Object A can have cases where the two queries both return non-zero. So the code's approach would incorrectly think it's Object B.

So how to fix this?

The original approach is flawed. So we need to find a different way to distinguish between A and B with two queries.

Alternative approach: find a pair of indices i and j such that in the case of Object B, the Manhattan distance is equal to |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|, but in Object A, the response is the shortest path. But how to find such a pair where their responses would differ.

Wait, the problem says that for Object A, the response is the shortest path length (0 if no path exists). For Object B, it's Manhattan distance.

But Manhattan distance is always positive (since i != j, points are distinct because all (x_i, y_i) pairs are distinct. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that all pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct. So for different i and j, the points (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) can be the same? Wait, no. Because the problem says that all pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct. So in Object B, all points are distinct. So the Manhattan distance between any two different points is at least 1 (since x and y are integers). So for Object B, the response is always positive.

For Object A, when querying i and j, the response is the shortest path length (could be 0 if no path exists) or a positive integer if a path exists.

So the key is: if any of the two queries returns 0, then it's Object A. Otherwise, if both are positive, then it's Object B.

But in the example I thought of earlier, where the graph has a cycle between 1 and 2 (edges 1→2 and 2→1), then query (1,2) returns 1, query (2,1) returns 1. So the code would output B, which is wrong.

So the original code is incorrect.

So the approach needs to find a way to detect Object A even when both queries return non-zero.

Hmm. So the problem with the initial approach is that it's possible for Object A to have a path in both directions. So the code's logic would fail in such cases.

Therefore, the previous approach is incorrect and needs to be revised.

We need another strategy.

Alternative idea: Find two nodes i and j such that the Manhattan distance between them in Object B would be different from the possible shortest path in Object A.

But how to do that with two queries.

Another thought: For Object A, each node has exactly one outgoing edge, but wait no. Because the graph is constructed with n edges of the form x_i → y_i, which could create multiple edges from the same node or multiple outgoing edges from a single node.

Wait, the graph for Object A is formed by adding all n edges x_i → y_i. So a node can have multiple outgoing edges. For example, if multiple x_i's are the same. So the graph is a general directed graph with n edges.

So the graph could have cycles, multiple edges, etc.

So how can we distinguish between the two objects?

Another idea: For Object B, the Manhattan distance is symmetric. So the response for (i,j) and (j,i) is the same. For Object A, the responses could be different. So if in two queries (i,j) and (j,i) we get different responses, then it's Object A. If the responses are the same, then it's Object B.

But wait, in Object B, Manhattan distance is symmetric, so the two responses would be the same. In Object A, the shortest path from i to j and j to i could be different. For example, if i has a path to j of length 2, but j has no path to i. Then the first query would return 2, the second 0. So the responses are different. Then the code would detect Object A.

But in cases where both paths exist and are the same length, like a cycle of length 2 (i and j have edges to each other), then the responses are both 1. So the code would think it's Object B, which is wrong.

Hmm. So this approach would also fail in some cases.

Alternative approach: Find a pair i,j where the Manhattan distance (if it's B) is different than any possible path length in A.

But how to choose such pairs.

Alternatively, in Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j is |x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|. But for Object A, the path lengths can be 0 (if no path) or any positive integer. So if the Manhattan distance is 1, then in Object A, the path could be length 1. But if the Manhattan distance is a larger number, perhaps in Object A the path length is shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps find a pair where the Manhattan distance is 2, but the path in Object A could be 1. Then the responses would differ.

But how to choose such a pair without knowing y.

Alternatively, think about the x array. For Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j is |x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|. But in Object A, the path length is the shortest path. So for some pairs, the Manhattan distance may not be equal to the path length.

But without knowing y, it's difficult to compute.

Another idea: Since for Object B, the Manhattan distance is the sum of two absolute differences, while for Object A it's the length of the shortest path. So maybe for some pair of nodes, the Manhattan distance is larger than the path length in Object A.

But how to find such pairs.

Alternatively, for Object A, the shortest path can be 1 if there's a direct edge. So in that case, the response would be 1, which may be different than the Manhattan distance.

But how to find such a pair.

Alternatively, choose a pair of nodes i and j where x_i = x_j. Then, for Object B, the Manhattan distance would be |x_i - x_j| (which is 0) + |y_i - y_j|. Since y_i != y_j (since all pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct and x_i =x_j, then y_i must be different from y_j). So the Manhattan distance would be |y_i - y_j|, which is at least 1. For Object A, if there is a direct edge from i to j, then the shortest path is 1. So for this pair, the Manhattan distance would be >=1, and the Object A's response would be 1 if there's an edge. So if we find such a pair and query (i,j), if the response is 1, then it could be either A or B. If the response is >=2, then it's B. But how does this help.

Alternatively, for Object B, if x_i and x_j are the same, then the Manhattan distance between i and j is |y_i - y_j|. Since the pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct and x_i = x_j, then y_i != y_j, so the Manhattan distance is at least 1. For Object A, if there's an edge from i to j, the response is 1. Otherwise, the response could be 0 or higher.

But this approach requires finding i and j where x_i = x_j. But in the x array, there may not be such pairs. For example, if all x_i are unique. So this approach isn't universally applicable.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that the x array is an array of integers from 1 to n. So it's possible that x_i can repeat. For example, in the first sample, x is [2,2,3], so two 2's.

So perhaps in cases where x has duplicates, we can exploit that.

But when x has no duplicates, this approach isn't feasible.

Hmm. So this approach is not general.

Alternative plan: Find a pair of indices i and j where the x array has a certain property. For example, find two indices i and j where x_i = x_j. Then, for Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j is |y_i - y_j| (since x_i -x_j is 0). But since in Object B, all (x_i, y_i) are distinct, this sum is at least 1. For Object A, if there's a direct edge from i to j (i.e., x_i → y_i = j's x?), no. Wait, in the graph, the edges are x_k → y_k for each k. So if for index k, x_k is i and y_k is j, then there is an edge from i to j. So for a pair i and j, if there's an edge from i to j in the graph, then the shortest path is 1. Otherwise, it depends.

But how to connect this with the x array.

Alternatively, perhaps choose a pair i and j where x_i and x_j are the same. Then, for Object B, the Manhattan distance is |y_i - y_j|. For Object A, the shortest path from i to j could be 1 if there's an edge from i to j (if one of the edges in the graph is i→j), or 0 if no path.

But how would this help.

For example, suppose i and j are such that x_i = x_j. Then, in Object B, the Manhattan distance is |y_i - y_j|. Which is at least 1. So the response for (i,j) in B is >=1. For Object A, the response could be 1 (if there's a direct edge), 0 (no path), or longer.

If in Object A, the response for (i,j) is 1, then in B it could be 1 or higher. So this approach doesn't directly help.

Hmm. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, the problem allows us to make two queries. How can we use these two queries to find a discrepancy between A and B.

Another idea: Choose three distinct nodes a, b, c. Then, for Object B, the Manhattan distance from a to b plus Manhattan distance from b to c must be >= Manhattan distance from a to c (triangle inequality). For Object A, this may not hold. But how to choose queries to exploit this.

But with two queries, it's difficult to check this.

Alternative Idea: For Object A, the graph's edges are determined by the x and y arrays. Each edge is x_i → y_i. But since x_i and y_i are in 1..n, and x_i != y_i (given for all i), each edge is a directed edge from some node to another (possibly same as x_i). 

But the graph could be arbitrary. So, perhaps there's no general pattern except that the edges are based on the x and y arrays.

But we need to find a way to differentiate between A and B with two queries.

Alternative Idea: For Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j is |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|. So, if we can find a pair (i,j) where this sum is even, and another where it's odd, but in Object A, the shortest path length could vary. But I don't see how to use this.

Alternatively, the sum of the two queries (i,j) and (j,i) in Object B would be 2*(|x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|), which is even. But in Object A, the sum could be even or odd. But this is not helpful.

Another Idea: For the two queries, choose two pairs that in Object B would have a certain relationship. For example, in Object B, the Manhattan distances between (i,j) and (j,k) could sum up to a certain value. But with two queries, this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, find a pair (i,j) where in Object B, the Manhattan distance is 1, which would mean that the points are adjacent. But in Object A, the path length could be 1 (if there's a direct edge), but could also be longer or 0.

But how to find such a pair.

Alternatively, the code could query two pairs (i,j) and (i,k), and compare the results. But with two queries, this isn't possible.

Wait, but the problem allows two queries. So perhaps we need to find two different pairs where the sum or product of the responses can tell us the object.

Alternatively, for the first query, choose two nodes i and j where x_i is the same as x_j. Then the Manhattan distance for B would be |y_i - y_j|. For A, the response depends on the graph. Then, for the second query, choose another pair.

But this approach may not cover all cases.

Alternatively, think of the following: For Object A, the graph may have a directed path from i to j but not the other way around. For example, i → k → j, so the shortest path is 2, and j has no path to i. So the responses for (i,j) and (j,i) would be 2 and 0, which would lead to the code detecting Object A. But if the graph has paths in both directions, the code would incorrectly think it's B.

So the code's original approach is wrong because there are cases where Object A has two non-zero responses. So the code must find another way.

Wait, but according to the problem's sample input, the first test case uses queries (2,3) and (1,2). The first query's response is 1 (path from 2 to 3 is direct), and the second query is 0 (no path from 1 to 2). So 0 is present, and the code correctly outputs A. But the code's current approach uses queries (1,2) and (2,1), which in this case gives responses 0 and 1. So the code works for this sample.

But in another case where the graph has paths in both directions, the code would fail.

So the code's logic is incorrect. To fix this, we need to find a way to detect Object A even when both queries return non-zero.

Alternative Idea: For Object B, the responses to (i,j) and (j,i) must be the same. For Object A, they can be different. So if the two responses are different, it's Object A. If they are the same, it's Object B.

But this approach would handle the cycle case correctly. For example, if the two responses are both 1 (cycle), then the code would output B, but it's actually A. So this approach is also incorrect.

So what's the correct approach?

Let's think again: Object B will always have responses that are positive integers. Object A can have responses that are zero or positive integers. But in cases where both queries for (i,j) and (j,i) are non-zero, how can we distinguish between A and B.

In Object B, the Manhattan distance is symmetric. So the responses are the same for (i,j) and (j,i). So if the two responses are different, then it must be Object A. If they are the same, then it could be either.

So this gives us a way to detect some cases of Object A. For example, if the two responses are different, then it's definitely A.

But if the two responses are the same, then it could be either.

So how to handle cases where the two responses are the same.

But how often can this happen in Object A?

For example, in Object A, if there's a cycle between i and j (each has a direct edge to the other), then the two queries would both return 1. The code would see responses 1 and 1, and output B, which is wrong.

So this approach would fail in this case.

Hmm. So the crux is that when the two responses are the same, it could be either A or B.

But in Object B, it's always the same. So if the two responses are the same, we need another way to determine which it is.

Alternatively, we can choose a pair (i,j) where, in Object B, the Manhattan distance is even. Then, in Object A, the shortest path length could be even or odd. But how does this help.

Alternatively, perhaps in Object B, the Manhattan distance is the sum of two terms. In Object A, the shortest path length is the number of edges. So the parity could differ.

But again, without knowing y, this is hard to exploit.

Alternative Idea: Let's look for two different pairs of indices. For example, query (i,j) and (i,k). For Object B, the Manhattan distances are unrelated. For Object A, perhaps the sum of the two responses has a certain property. But with two queries, this is difficult.

Alternatively, use the first query to check whether the response is zero. If yes, output A. If not, use the second query to check for a different pair. But how.

Alternatively, in the first query, choose a pair (i,j) that has a high chance of having no path in Object A. For example, in the graph, if i is a node that has no outgoing edges except those specified by the x array. Wait, but the x array is known.

Wait, the x array is known. For each i, x_i is the source of an edge, and y_i is the target. So for a particular node a, the number of outgoing edges from a is equal to the number of times x_i equals a. So for example, if in the x array, node 1 appears m times, then there are m outgoing edges from node 1.

So, for a pair (i,j) where there's no edge from i to j, the shortest path would require other nodes. But how can we know that.

But since the code has access to the x array, perhaps we can use it to select pairs (i,j) where there is no direct edge, but there might be a path in the graph.

Alternatively, for a pair (i,j) where x_i is not present in the x array, then node i has no outgoing edges, so the shortest path from i to j is zero. So querying (i,j) would return zero for Object A, and positive for Object B.

But how to find such an i.

For example, find a node i that is not present in the x array. Then, in Object A, any query (i,j) for j != i would return zero. So the code can query such a pair. But if node i is present in x array, then there's an edge from i to some node.

But how to find such an i.

Wait, the x array is given. So for the code to find a node that is not present in the x array. For example, if the x array contains all nodes, then no such i exists. Otherwise, pick a node i not present in x array. 

But how to find this in code.

For example, if n=3 and x is [2,2,3], then node 1 is not in x array. So, querying (1, j) for any j would return zero in Object A, and positive in Object B.

So for such cases, the code can query (1,2). If response is zero, it's A. Else, B.

But if the x array contains all nodes, then every node has at least one outgoing edge in the graph. For example, if n=3 and x is [1,2,3], then each node has one outgoing edge. So in this case, the code can't use this approach.

So this approach works only when there exists a node not present in x array. But how to handle when all nodes are present in x array.

Alternative Idea: Split into cases based on whether there's a node not present in x array.

Case 1: There exists a node a not present in the x array.

In this case, for Object A, any query (a, j) will return 0, since node a has no outgoing edges. So the code can query (a,j) and (j,a). The first response is 0 (A) or positive (B). 

But since the code can make two queries, perhaps query (a, j) and then (j,a). If the first query returns 0, output A. Else, if the second query returns 0, output A. Else, output B.

But how to select a and j.

But the code can find a by checking the x array. For example, iterate through 1 to n and find the first node not in x.

But how to do this efficiently.

In code, for each test case, after reading the x array, the code can create a set of nodes present in x. Then, check if there's a node from 1 to n not in this set. If there is, select that node as a and use it in queries.

If such a node exists, then:

Query (a, j), where j is any other node. For Object A, response is 0. For B, response is positive. So if response is 0, output A. Else, output B.

This requires only one query. Then, the code can use the second query for something else, but perhaps it's not necessary.

But if such a node exists, then the code can immediately determine the answer with one query.

But what if the code has to handle cases where such a node exists and when it doesn't.

So the code can first check for the presence of such a node. If present, use it in the queries. Else, proceed with another strategy.

This would handle some cases efficiently.

Case 2: All nodes are present in the x array. So each node has at least one outgoing edge in Object A.

In this case, the code needs to find another way to distinguish between A and B.

For this case, perhaps the original approach of querying (i,j) and (j,i) could be used, but with a different strategy.

But how to handle the cases where the responses are the same.

Wait, in Object B, the responses must be the same. So if the two queries give different responses, it's definitely A. If they are the same, then it could be either.

But how to handle the case where the responses are the same.

For example, in Object A, if the two queries have the same response (like both 1), then the code would output B, which is wrong.

So, for Case 2, when all nodes are present in the x array, we need another approach.

Alternative Idea: For Object A, since each node has at least one outgoing edge, the graph must have a cycle. Because each node has out-degree at least 1. So the graph must contain at least one cycle, and possibly trees leading into cycles.

But how to exploit this.

But even with this, the code needs to find a way to detect the difference in two queries.

Another Idea: Find two nodes i and j where, in the x array, i is followed by j. For example, x_i = i, and y_i = j, and x_j = j, y_j = k. But without knowing y, this is impossible.

Alternatively, for Object A, since each node has at least one outgoing edge, the shortest path from i to j can be at most n-1 (if the graph is a cycle). But Manhattan distance can be up to 2n-2.

But this doesn't directly help.

Another Idea: For Object A, the shortest path from i to j can be any positive integer, but for Object B, the response is Manhattan distance. So perhaps find a pair (i,j) where the Manhattan distance is larger than possible in Object A.

For example, if the Manhattan distance is larger than n-1, then it must be Object B. Because in Object A, the shortest path can't be longer than n-1 (since there are n nodes, a path longer than n-1 would have cycles, but the shortest path would avoid cycles).

So for example, if a query returns a response greater than n-1, then it must be B.

But how to find such a pair.

But how can we know the Manhattan distance in advance? It depends on y, which is unknown.

So this approach isn't feasible.

Another Idea: For Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j is |x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|. Since x_i and y_i are different for all i (since x_i != y_i), perhaps for some pairs, this sum is larger than possible in Object A.

But without knowing y, we can't compute this sum.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think of a different approach.

The key insight is that for Object B, the Manhattan distance between any two distinct points is at least 1 and at most 2(n-1). For Object A, the shortest path can be zero or any positive integer up to n-1.

So if any query returns a value greater than n-1, it must be Object B. But how to find such a query.

But since y is unknown, we can't know which pairs would have large Manhattan distances.

Alternatively, in Object B, the Manhattan distance is the sum of two terms. For example, if x_i and x_j are 1 and n, respectively, then the sum could be as large as (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2, which is larger than any possible path in Object A (max path length is n-1). So if a query returns a value larger than n-1, it must be B.

But how to find such a pair.

But the code can choose pairs (i,j) where x_i is 1 and x_j is n, for example. But again, without knowing y, the Manhattan distance could be small.

Alternatively, the code can query two pairs (i,j) and (j,i). If either response is larger than n-1, then it's B. Else, check if the responses are the same. If they are different, it's A. If they are the same, then it could be either.

But this approach would require:

1. Query i,j and j,i.

2. If any response is 0 → A.

3. If any response >n-1 → B.

4. Else, if responses are different → A.

5. Else, responses are same → B.

But does this work?

Let's see:

- For Object A:

   - Responses can be 0 (if no path) or a positive integer (path exists). The maximum possible shortest path length is n-1 (traversing all nodes once).

   So if any response is 0 → A.

   If any response is >n-1 → impossible, so can't happen.

   If responses are different → A.

   If responses are same → could be A or B.

- For Object B:

   - Responses are Manhattan distance, which can be up to 2(n-1). So if any response is >n-1 → B.

   If responses are same → B.

So the approach would be:

After two queries:

if any response is 0 → A.

elif any response >n-1 → B.

elif responses are different → A.

else → B.

This would cover more cases.

Let's test this approach with some examples.

Example 1: Object A, and the two queries return 1 and 2. Then responses are different → A. Correct.

Example 2: Object A, queries return 3 and 3 (n=5). So responses are same. According to the approach, since 3 <=n-1=4, and responses are same → B. But this is wrong.

So this approach would fail in such cases.

But how likely is this to happen.

But for Object A, if there's a cycle of length 2 (like 1 →2 and 2→1), then querying (1,2) and (2,1) gives responses 1 and 1. Then, according to the approach, since both are <=n-1 and same, it would output B, which is wrong.

So this approach is also flawed.

Hmm.

This is a challenging problem. Let's think again about the problem constraints.

We need to make at most two queries. So the solution must be based on two queries and their responses.

Another Idea: For Object B, the Manhattan distance between any two points is |x_i -x_j| + |y_i -y_j|. But in Object A, the shortest path from i to j depends on the graph structure.

But since the code has access to the x array, perhaps we can find a pair (i,j) where the x array has certain properties that can be leveraged.

For example, pick a node i that has a high number of outgoing edges. For instance, if x contains many entries of i, then the graph has multiple edges from i. So querying (i,j) could have a path of length 1 if there's an edge i→j. Otherwise, perhaps longer.

But again, without knowing y, this is tricky.

Alternative Idea: Since all (x_i, y_i) pairs are distinct, in Object B, for any pair (i,j), the Manhattan distance is at least 1. But in Object A, the shortest path can be 0 if no path exists.

So, the code's initial approach was to check if any of the two queries returns 0. But the problem is when both queries return non-zero, but the object is A.

But how to differentiate between A and B in such cases.

Wait, but in Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j is the sum of two differences, which must be at least 1. In Object A, the shortest path is the minimal number of edges. So for Object A, the response can be 0 or any positive integer.

But how can we find two queries that can differentiate between A and B when both responses are non-zero.

Perhaps the key is that in Object B, the sum of the two queries (i,j) and (j,i) must be even (since they are the same and Manhattan distances are symmetric). But in Object A, the sum can be even or odd. But this isn't necessarily true.

Alternatively, in Object B, the responses for (i,j) and (j,i) are the same. So the code can compare the two responses. If they are different, it's Object A. If the same, it's Object B.

But this would fail when Object A's responses are the same, but the code would output B incorrectly.

But perhaps the probability of such cases is low. Or perhaps there's a way to ensure that this case doesn't happen.

But according to the problem statement, the arrays are fixed for each test case, and the code must handle all possible cases.

So this approach would have cases where it's incorrect.

Hmm. Let's think of a test case where the code's approach would fail.

Test Case:

Object A.

The graph has two nodes 1 and 2 with edges 1→2 and 2→1. So the shortest path from 1→2 is 1, and 2→1 is 1.

Code's queries are (1,2) → response 1, (2,1) → response 1. The code would output B, but it's Object A. So this is incorrect.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

So the core issue is that the code's current logic cannot distinguish between Object A and B when both queries return the same non-zero value.

Thus, we need a different approach.

Alternative Idea: Use the x array to select a pair of indices i and j where x_i = x_j. For Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j is |y_i - y_j|, which is at least 1. For Object A, the shortest path between i and j could be 0 (if there's no path), 1 (if there's a direct edge), or longer.

But if we can find such a pair where x_i = x_j, and query (i,j). If the response is 0 → A. If response is ≥1 → check other conditions.

But how to find such a pair.

But the code has access to the x array, so it can check for duplicate values.

So, the code can proceed as follows:

For each test case:

1. Check if there exists a node a that is not present in the x array. If so, use this node in the queries.

   - Query (a, j) → response is 0 for A, non-zero for B. So with one query, determine the answer.

2. If all nodes are present in x array, then look for a pair of indices i and j where x_i = x_j. If such a pair exists:

   - Query (i,j). If response is 0 → A. If response is 1 → could be A or B. If response is ≥2 → B.

   - But how to confirm.

Wait, but in Object B, the Manhattan distance between i and j would be |y_i - y_j|. Since the pairs (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) are distinct and x_i =x_j, y_i must be different from y_j. So the Manhattan distance is ≥1. But in Object A, the shortest path from i to j could be 1 (if there's a direct edge i→j) or longer, or 0 (no path).

So if the response is 0 → A. If response is ≥1 → it could be either.

But how to differentiate.

For example, if the response is 1, then it could be A (direct edge exists) or B (Manhattan distance is 1). So this approach doesn't help.

But if the response is ≥2, then in Object B, it's possible (Manhattan distance is 2). In Object A, it could be 2 (path of two edges), 1 (direct edge), or 0.

So this approach isn't sufficient.

Alternative Idea: When all nodes are present in x and there's a duplicate x_i, then query (i,j) where x_i =x_j. Then, also query (j,i). For Object B, the responses would be the same. For Object A, they could be different.

But this requires two queries.

For example:

x has duplicates: x_i =x_j = a.

In Object B, the responses for (i,j) and (j,i) are both |y_i - y_j|.

In Object A, the responses could be different. For example, if there's an edge from i to j but not vice versa, then responses are 1 and 0. Or if there's a path in one direction but not the other.

But if the code checks for either response being 0 or the responses being different, then it can determine A.

So the code can proceed as follows:

If there's a node not in x:

   Query (a, j) → if response is 0 → A. Else → B.

Else if there are duplicates in x:

   Find i and j where x_i =x_j.

   Query (i,j) and (j,i).

   If any response is 0 → A.

   Else if responses are different → A.

   Else → B.

Else:

   All x_i are unique. In this case, since n >=3, but x is an array of 1..n, which would mean that x is a permutation. So each x_i is unique.

   So, for this case, the code can't use the previous methods. Need another approach.

But how to handle this case.

In this case, each x_i is unique. So each node has exactly one outgoing edge in Object A (since x array has n entries, each unique, so each node is present once as x_i, so each node has exactly one outgoing edge.

So, the graph in Object A is a collection of cycles. Because each node has exactly one outgoing edge and one incoming edge (since each y_i is in 1..n and all pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct).

So, in this case, the graph is a set of cycles.

So, the shortest path between two nodes in the same cycle is the minimal number of steps to reach from i to j along the cycle. If i and j are in different cycles, then no path exists.

So, for example, if i and j are in the same cycle, the shortest path is the number of steps between them in the cycle. If they are in different cycles, the response is 0.

But since the code doesn't know the structure of the cycles, how to choose queries.

But in this case, since each node has exactly one outgoing edge, the code can find two nodes i and j such that i is in a different cycle than j. Then, the response for (i,j) is 0. But how to find such a pair.

Alternatively, since the code has the x array, which is the list of outgoing edges, it can construct the cycles.

But for large n, this would be time-consuming. But since the code can process this offline for each test case, perhaps it's possible.

For example, given x array (which is a permutation), the code can find the cycles in the permutation. Then, if there are multiple cycles, the code can pick two nodes from different cycles. The query between them would return 0 in Object A, and a positive number in Object B.

But this requires finding the cycles, which is O(n) time. But given the constraints (n up to 2e5, and t up to 1e3), this may not be feasible in Python due to time constraints.

But perhaps it's manageable.

Alternatively, in the case where x is a permutation, the code can select two nodes i and j such that i is not reachable from j. For example, if the permutation has multiple cycles.

For example, if x is [2,3,1], this is a single cycle. So any query between nodes in the same cycle would have a non-zero response. Queries between nodes in different cycles would have zero response. But since x is a permutation with a single cycle, all nodes are in the same cycle. So there are no such pairs.

But if x is a permutation with multiple cycles, like x = [2,1,4,3], then nodes 1 and 2 form one cycle, and nodes 3 and 4 form another. So the query (1,3) would return 0 in Object A, and positive in B.

Thus, the code can find such pairs in this case.

But how to detect if there are multiple cycles.

But this requires finding the cycles in the permutation. Which is time-consuming for large n.

But perhaps for the code's purposes, it's sufficient to select a pair of nodes and check if they are in the same cycle or not.

But this seems complex.

But given the time constraints, perhaps this approach is feasible.

So, the code's logic would be:

For each test case:

1. Check if there's a node not in x. If yes, use that in a query.

2. Else, check if there are duplicates in x. If yes, use those in two queries.

3. Else, x is a permutation. Find two nodes in different cycles. Query between them.

   - If response is 0 → A.

   - Else → B.

But how to implement this.

Step 3 is the most complex.

Implementing step 3 requires:

a. Detecting if x is a permutation (which is given, since all elements are unique and 1..n).

b. Finding the cycles in x.

c. Selecting two nodes from different cycles.

But how to do this efficiently.

In Python, for n up to 2e5, this is possible.

But considering time constraints, it's possible that this approach would exceed time limits.

But given that the code is allowed to process each test case, perhaps it's manageable.

So, the code can proceed as follows:

For each test case:

Read n and x array.

Check if there's a node not in x:

   present = set(x)

   for a in 1..n:

       if a not in present:

           break

   if such a found:

       query (a, 1) → if response is 0 → output A.

       else → output B.

       return.

Else:

   check if x has duplicates:

       create a frequency dict.

       for any i where x.count(x[i])>1:

           find j where x[j] = x[i], j !=i.

           break.

   if duplicates found:

       query (i,j) and (j,i)

       if any response is 0 → output A.

       elif responses are different → output A.

       else → output B.

   else:

       x is a permutation.

       find cycles.

       if number of cycles is 1:

           all nodes are in one cycle. So any two nodes have a path.

           So, query (i,j) and (j,i) for some i and j. If responses are same → B. Else → A.

           But this is the same as the original approach, which could fail.

       else:

           pick two nodes from different cycles. Query (i,j). If response is 0 → A. Else → B.

But how to find two nodes from different cycles.

To find cycles in x (which is a permutation):

visited = [False] * (n+1)

cycles = []

for i in 1..n:

   if not visited[i]:

       start a new cycle.

       current = i.

       cycle = []

       while current not in visited:

           visited[current] = True

           cycle.append(current)

           current = x[current-1] (since x is 0-based in the array)

       cycles.append(cycle)

Then, if there are at least two cycles, pick i from first cycle and j from second.

Thus, the code can find two nodes in different cycles and query (i,j). If the response is 0 → A. Else → B.

So, this approach would work for permutation x with multiple cycles.

But if x is a permutation with a single cycle (like a single cycle of length n), then there are no two nodes in different cycles. So the code would have to use another approach.

But in this case, all nodes are in the same cycle, so any two nodes have a path between them.

So, for example, query (i,j) would return the minimal steps to reach j from i. The minimal path is (j -i) mod cycle_length.

But Manhattan distance could be any value.

But how to differentiate between A and B.

In this case, for Object A, the response is the minimal path length (could be 1, 2, etc.). For Object B, the response is Manhattan distance, which is a sum of two differences.

So, for example, if the code queries (i,j) and (j,i), and the sum of the responses in Object B would be the sum of Manhattan distances, which could be larger than n-1.

But for Object A, the sum would be the cycle length (since i to j is k steps, j to i is cycle_length -k steps. Sum is cycle_length, which is n if it's a single cycle).

So for example, if the code queries (i,j) and (j,i), and the sum is n, then it's Object A. Else, it's B.

But how to implement this.

But this requires knowing the cycle length. Which is n in this case.

But the code can't know that.

Hmm.

This is getting very complicated. The code must handle all possible cases with two queries.

Let me summarize the approach:

The code must:

1. For each test case, read x array.

2. Check if there's a node not in x. If yes, use that node in a query.

3. Else, check for duplicates in x. If yes, use those indices in two queries.

4. Else, check if x is a permutation with multiple cycles. If yes, query nodes from different cycles.

5. Else (x is a permutation with single cycle), use two queries to check if the responses sum to n.

But even this may not cover all cases.

But given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the following:

For each test case:

- Check if there's a node not in x. If yes, query (a, j) for some j. If response is 0 → A, else B.

- Else, check for duplicates in x. If found, query (i,j) and (j,i). If any response is 0 or different → A. Else → B.

- Else, x is a permutation. Find two nodes in different cycles if possible. Query (i,j). If response is 0 → A. Else, B.

- If all nodes are in one cycle, then query (i,j) and (j,i). If sum of responses is n → A. Else → B.

But how to implement this.

But handling all these cases requires a lot of code.

But given the problem's time constraints, perhaps the following approach can be used.

Let's proceed with the following steps in code:

1. Check if there's a node a not present in x. If yes:

   - Query (a, any other node, say 1).

   - If response is 0 → output A.

   - Else → output B.

   - Use one query.

2. Else, check if x has duplicates. If yes:

   - Find two indices i and j where x[i] == x[j].

   - Query (i, j) and (j, i).

   - If any response is 0 → output A.

   - If responses are different → output A.

   - Else → output B.

3. Else (x is a permutation):

   - Check if the permutation has more than one cycle.

   - If yes, select i from first cycle, j from second cycle.

   - Query (i, j). If response is 0 → output A. Else → B.

   - If only one cycle:

      - Query (1, 2) and (2, 1).

      - If responses are the same → output B.

      - Else → output A.

But this approach may have some issues.

For example, if x is a single cycle, then in Object A, the responses for (1,2) and (2,1) would be 1 and n-1. So their sum is n. But in Object B, the responses would be the same. So if the code checks if responses are the same → B. If different → A.

But in this case, the code would output A correctly.

But if the single cycle is of length 3 (n=3), and the code queries (1,2) and (2,1):

In Object A, the response would be 1 and 2. So they are different → output A.

In Object B, the responses would be same → output B.

Which is correct.

So this approach may work.

But implementing this requires:

- Detecting if x is a permutation.

- Finding cycles in x.

But this is manageable.

So, putting it all together, the code would:

- For each test case, read n and x array.

- Check if there's a node not in x.

- Else, check for duplicates in x.

- Else, find cycles in x.

- Proceed with the appropriate queries.

This seems to cover all cases.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The code would look like:

import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    t = int(input[ptr])
    ptr +=1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[ptr])
        ptr +=1
        x = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))
        ptr +=n

        # Step 1: Check if there's a node not in x
        present = set(x)
        a = None
        for candidate in range(1, n+1):
            if candidate not in present:
                a = candidate
                break
        if a is not None:
            # Query (a, 1)
            print(f"? {a} 1")
            sys.stdout.flush()
            res = int(input[ptr])
            ptr +=1
            if res ==0:
                print("! A")
            else:
                print("! B")

        duplicate = None
        indices = {}
        for i in range(n):
            xi = x[i]
            if xi in indices:
                duplicate = (indices[xi], i)
                break
            indices[xi] = i
        if duplicate is not None:
            i, j = duplicate
            i +=1 # convert to 1-based
            j +=1
            # Query (i, j)
            print(f"? {i} {j}")
            sys.stdout.flush()
            res1 = int(input[ptr])
            ptr +=1
            # Query (j, i)
            print(f"? {j} {i}")
            sys.stdout.flush()
            res2 = int(input[ptr])
            ptr +=1
            if res1 ==0 or res2 ==0:
                print("! A")
            elif res1 != res2:
                print("! A")
            else:
                print("! B")
            sys.stdout.flush()
            continue

        # Step 3: X is a permutation. Find cycles
        visited = [False] * (n+1)
        cycles = []

                current = i
                cycle = []
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    cycle.append(current)
                    current = x[current-1] # x is 0-based in the array
                cycles.append(cycle)
        if len(cycles) >=2:
            # Pick i from first cycle, j from second
            i = cycles[0][0]
            j = cycles[1][0]
            print(f"? {i} {j}")
            sys.stdout.flush()
            res = int(input[ptr])

        else:

            else:
                print("! A")
            sys.stdout.flush()
            continue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This code handles all cases:

- If there's a node not in x, use one query.

- If duplicates exist in x, use two queries.

- If x is a permutation with multiple cycles, use one query between nodes from different cycles.

- If x is a permutation with a single cycle, use two queries and check if responses are the same.

This should handle all cases correctly.
