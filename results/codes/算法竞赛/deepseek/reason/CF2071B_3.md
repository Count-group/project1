Okay, let's try to figure out why the previous code isn't passing all the sample test cases. Let's look at the sample inputs again.

The demo input has three cases:

1. Input 1 → Output -1 (correct, as sum is 1 which is a square)
2. Input 4 → Output 2 4 1 3. Let's check the sums here:
   - 2 → not square
   - 2+4=6 → not square
   - 6+1=7 → not square
   - 7+3=10 → not square. So this works.
3. Input 5 → Output 5 1 4 3 2. Let's check sums:
   - 5 → not square
   - 5+1=6 → not square
   - 6+4=10 → not square
   - 10+3=13 → not square
   - 13+2=15 → not square. So this works.

The previous code for n=4 would generate [2,1,4,3] when n=4. Let's see:

sum after first element: 2 → okay.
sum after second: 3 → which is 1+2=3. Wait, but the permutation is [2,1,4,3], sum after two elements is 2+1=3. Oh, wait, 3 is not a square. So that's okay. Then 3+4=7, which is not square. Then 7+3=10. All good. So this permutation seems valid. But the sample output for n=4 is [2,4,1,3]. So the previous code's output for n=4 would be [2,1,4,3], which is different from the sample but should still be valid. Wait, but maybe the code's output is incorrect for some cases?

Wait, the previous code for n=4 would generate [2,1,4,3]. Let's check the prefix sums:

1st element: 2 → okay.
2nd: 3 → okay.
3rd: 3+4=7 → okay.
4th: 7+3=10 → okay. So all sums are non-squares. So the permutation is valid, even though it's different from the sample. So why does the sample output have a different permutation? Because the problem allows any valid permutation. So the code's output for n=4 should be acceptable. However, maybe the code is producing a permutation that for some other values of n has a sum that's a square.

Wait, let's check another test case. Let's take n=5. According to the code, when n=5, the code would generate [2,1,5,4,3]. Let's compute the sums:

1: 2 → ok.
2: 3 → ok.
3: 3+5=8 → not square.
4: 8+4=12 → not square.
5: 12+3=15 → ok. So that's valid. But the sample output for n=5 is [5,1,4,3,2]. So the code's output is different but still correct. So why is the code not passing the samples? Wait, perhaps the code is not handling n=4 correctly. Let me check what the code does for n=4.

In the code, for n>2, the permutation is [2,1] followed by range(n, 2, -1). So for n=4, that's [2,1] + [4,3]. So the permutation is [2,1,4,3]. Which is valid. But the sample expects [2,4,1,3]. So the code's output is different but correct. So maybe the code is correct, but the sample just shows one possible solution. The problem says "if there are multiple solutions, print any of them". So perhaps the code is correct, but the user is thinking it's wrong because the output doesn't match the sample. But in that case, the code is correct. So why is the user saying the output doesn't pass all samples?

Wait, maybe there's a different problem. Let's check another case. Let's take n=3. According to the code's approach, the total sum is 6, which is not a square. So code generates [2,1,3]. Let's check the sums:

1:2 → ok.
2:3 → ok.
3:6 → which is a perfect square. Oh! So the sum after 3 elements is 6, which is 2^2 + 2^2, but wait, 6 is not a perfect square. Wait 2.449^2 is 6. So 6 is not a perfect square. So the permutation [2,1,3] for n=3 is valid. But wait, let me compute the sums again.

Wait, sum after first element is 2 (not square). Sum after two: 3 (not square). Sum after three: 6 (not square). So that's okay. So code's output for n=3 is [2,1,3], which is valid.

But let's think of another case. For example, n=7. The code's permutation would be [2,1,7,6,5,4,3]. Let's compute the prefix sums:

1:2 → ok.
2:3 → ok.
3:3+7=10 → ok.
4:10+6=16 → which is 4^2. Oh no! So the sum after 4 elements is 16, which is a square. So this permutation is invalid. So the code's approach is incorrect.

Ah, here's the problem. The code's approach works for n=4,5, etc., but for some values like n=7, the generated permutation leads to a prefix sum that is a square. So the approach of appending numbers in reverse order (3 to n) after [2,1] is not correct.

So the problem lies in the construction of the permutation. The initial idea was to start with 2,1 to avoid the sum of 1 (since 1 is a square), but the way the rest of the numbers are added may lead to a sum that's a square later on.

For example, in the case of n=7:

Permutation is [2,1,7,6,5,4,3]

Prefix sums:

2 → ok.

3 → ok.

3+7=10 → ok.

10+6=16 → which is 4^2. So that's invalid. So this permutation is not acceptable. Hence, the code's approach is wrong.

So the problem with the current approach is that after the initial elements, adding larger numbers can result in a prefix sum that's a square.

So how to construct a permutation that avoids all prefix sums being squares?

Alternative approach: Find a way to arrange the elements so that each prefix sum is not a square. The initial approach may not work for all n.

Alternative idea: Reverse the entire permutation. For example, the sample for n=5 is [5,1,4,3,2]. Let's see the sums:

5 → ok (5 not square)

5+1=6 → ok.

6+4=10 → ok.

10+3=13 → ok.

13+2=15 → ok.

So the permutation is arranged as 5, then 1, then 4, 3, 2. Maybe the pattern is to start with a large number, then 1, then others in some order.

Another approach: For n >=2, arrange the permutation in such a way that the first element is a large number (like n), then 1, followed by the rest in some order that avoids prefix sums.

Wait, let's try for n=7.

If permutation starts with 7, then 1.

Sum after 1:7 → ok.

Sum after 2:8 → not square.

Then add the next elements in a way that each step's sum is not a square.

So after 7 and 1, the sum is 8. Next element could be 2. Sum becomes 10. Then 3: 13. Then 4: 17. Then 5: 22. Then 6: 28. All these sums are not squares.

But the permutation would be [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]. But this is a permutation. Let's check:

Sum after 1:7 → ok.

Sum after 2:8 → ok.

Sum after 3:10 → ok.

Sum after 4:13 → ok.

Sum after 5:17 → ok.

Sum after 6:22 → ok.

Sum after 7:28 → ok. All are non-squares. So this permutation works.

But how to construct such a permutation for any n >=2, provided the total sum is not a square.

But how to generalize this approach. The initial elements are [n,1], then the rest in order 2,3,...,n-1. Let's see:

n=4: permutation would be [4,1,2,3]. Sums:

4 → ok.

5 → ok.

7 → ok.

10 → ok. Which is correct. But the sample has [2,4,1,3]. But this is also correct.

Another test case: n=3.

Permutation [3,1,2]. Sums:

3 → ok.

4 → which is a square (2^2). So that's invalid. Oh, so this approach doesn't work for n=3.

So the problem is that after the first two elements (n and 1), adding 2 leads to a sum of n+1+2 = sum of first three elements. For n=3, that's 3+1+2=6, which is not a square. Wait, wait, for n=3, the permutation [3,1,2]. Sum after first element is 3. Sum after second is 4 (which is 2^2). So that's invalid. So this approach also has a problem.

Hmm. So the approach of starting with n,1 and then 2,3, etc. may not work for all n.

Alternative idea: For the permutation, after the first two elements, arrange the remaining elements in such a way that each step's sum is checked to avoid squares. But this would be difficult for large n.

Alternative approach: Let's look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

Sample for n=4: [2,4,1,3]. The prefix sums are 2, 6, 7, 10.

Sample for n=5: [5,1,4,3,2]. Sums are 5, 6, 10, 13, 15.

Notice that the first element is chosen such that it is not 1. Then, the second element is 1. Then the rest are arranged in a way that the sum increases but avoids squares.

So maybe the general approach is to swap 1 to the second position and arrange the other elements in reverse order.

Wait, let's think about this:

Permutation for n=5: 5,1,4,3,2. So first element is 5, then 1, then 4,3,2.

Sum after 5:5 → ok.

Sum after 5+1=6 → ok.

Sum after adding 4:10 → ok.

Adding 3:13 → ok.

Adding 2:15 → ok.

So for n=4, the permutation is 2,4,1,3. Which is:

Sum after 2:2 → ok.

Sum after 6 → ok.

Sum after 7 → ok.

Sum after 10 → ok.

So perhaps the approach is:

- Place 2 first, then the largest remaining numbers, then 1, then the others in reverse.

Alternatively, perhaps the general approach is to arrange the permutation as follows:

If n is 2: [2,1].

For n >2:

Start with 2, then arrange the numbers from 4 to n in reverse order, then 1, then 3 in reverse.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, after the first two elements (like 2 and 4 for n=4), then 1 and 3. For n=5, starts with 5,1,4,3,2.

Another pattern: when n is even:

For n=4: 2,4,1,3.

n=6: 2,6,5,1,4,3.

Check sums:

n=6:

sum1=2.

sum2=8 → ok.

sum3=13 → ok.

sum4=14 → ok.

sum5=18 → ok.

sum6=21 → ok.

So that seems to work.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to place 2 first, then the largest possible number (n), then n-1, n-2, etc., then 1, and then the remaining numbers in reverse.

But how to formalize this.

Alternatively, let's see the sample for n=4 and n=5:

n=4: [2,4,1,3]. After 2, the next is 4 (the largest possible), then 1, then 3 (remaining numbers).

n=5: [5,1,4,3,2]. Here, the first element is 5 (the largest), then 1, then 4,3,2 (reverse of remaining numbers).

So perhaps the correct approach is:

For n >=2:

If the total sum is a square, return -1.

Otherwise:

If n is even:

Construct the permutation as [2, n, n-1, ..., 3, 1].

Wait, for n=4, that would be [2,4,3,1]. Let's check sums:

sum1=2 → ok.

sum2=6 → ok.

sum3=9 → which is 3^2. Oh, so that's invalid.

Hmm, so that's not good.

Alternatively, for n=4, the sample uses [2,4,1,3]. Let's see:

sum1=2.

sum2=6.

sum3=7.

sum4=10.

So after placing 2,4, then 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps the general approach is to place 2 first, then the largest possible number (n), then the next largest (n-1), etc., but inserting 1 in a position that ensures that the sum doesn't become a square.

Alternatively, after the first element (2), the next elements are n, n-1, ..., but insert 1 before a certain point.

Alternatively, think of the permutation as [2, n, n-1, ..., 3, 1].

Wait for n=4, that would be [2,4,3,1]. Let's check sums:

sum1=2 → ok.

sum2=6 → ok.

sum3=9 → 3² → invalid.

So this permutation is invalid.

So that approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: For even n, arrange the permutation as [2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, ...] but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the sample for n=5 is [5,1,4,3,2]. The sum after adding 1 is 5+1=6. Then 6+4=10, etc. So the key is to have the sum after the first two elements be a non-square, and then add the remaining elements in a way that each addition doesn't create a square.

Let's think about the general approach. The first element is a number that ensures the sum is not a square. Then, each subsequent element is added such that the cumulative sum is not a square.

But how to construct this permutation efficiently for large n.

Alternative approach: For n >=2:

- Start the permutation with n, then 1. This gives sum n +1, which for n >=2 is 3 or more (since n=2 gives sum 3, n=3 gives sum 4 (which is square), which is a problem).

Wait, for n=3, sum after first two elements is 3+1=4 (square), so this approach would fail.

But the sample for n=5 starts with 5 and 1. Sum is 6 (non-square). Then adding 4 (sum 10), 3 (sum 13), 2 (sum 15). All non-squares.

So for n=3, this approach would start with 3,1. Sum after two elements is 4 (square). So that's invalid.

So the approach of starting with n and 1 only works when n+1 is not a square.

So how to handle n=3? For n=3, total sum is 6 (not square). So a valid permutation must exist.

The code's previous approach was [2,1,3], which sum after two elements is 3 (non-square), sum after three elements is 6 (non-square). So this permutation is valid.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

If n is 1 → -1.

Else check if total sum is square → if yes, -1.

Else, for the permutation:

If n == 2 → [2,1]

Else:

Start with [2,1], then add the remaining numbers in reverse order (3,4,...,n → but reversed as n, n-1,...,3).

Wait, for n=3 → [2,1,3]. Sums are 2,3,6. All non-squares. So valid.

For n=4 → [2,1,4,3]. Sums 2,3,7,10. All good.

For n=5 → [2,1,5,4,3]. Sums:

2 → ok.

3 → ok.

3+5=8 → ok.

8+4=12 → ok.

12+3=15 → ok. All sums are non-squares.

For n=7 → [2,1,7,6,5,4,3]. Sums:

2 → ok.

3 → ok.

3+7=10 → ok.

10+6=16 → square. Oh no! So this approach fails for n=7.

So the problem is that when we add the remaining numbers in reverse order, the sum after adding 7 and 6 (sum 10+6=16) is a square. So this approach isn't sufficient.

So the previous code's approach works for some values but not others. So we need a better way to construct the permutation.

Alternative Idea:

The sum after the first two elements (2 and 1) is 3. Then, for the next elements, we need to add them in such a way that the sum doesn't become a square. So for the third element, we need to add a number such that 3 + x is not a square. Then, for each subsequent element, the same.

So for the third element, possible x is 3, but adding 3 gives sum 6 (not a square). Then next element is 4: sum 10 (ok). Then next is 5: sum 15 (ok). Then next is 6: sum 21 (ok). Then next is 7: sum 28 (ok). So for n=7, if the permutation is [2,1,3,4,5,6,7], the sums would be 2,3,6,10,15,21,28. None are squares. So this permutation is valid.

But this is a different arrangement. But how to generate such a permutation.

But this approach requires that after the first two elements, the remaining are in increasing order. But for n=3, this would be [2,1,3], which works. For n=4, [2,1,3,4], sum after three is 6 (non-square), sum after four is 10 (ok).

But what about n=7:

sum after third element (3) is 6 → ok.

sum after fourth (4) is 10 → ok.

sum after fifth (5) is 15 → ok.

sum after sixth (6) is 21 → ok.

sum after seventh (7) is 28 → ok. All sums are non-squares. So this permutation is valid.

So perhaps the correct approach is to start with [2,1] followed by the numbers from 3 to n in increasing order.

But for n=7, the permutation would be [2,1,3,4,5,6,7]. Let's check:

Sum after first element: 2 → ok.

Sum after two:3 → ok.

Sum after three:6 → ok.

Sum after four:10 → ok.

Sum after five:15 → ok.

Sum after six:21 → ok.

Sum after seven:28 → ok. All sums are non-squares.

But wait, what about n=5:

Permutation [2,1,3,4,5]. Sum after three is 6, sum after four is 10, sum after five is 15. All ok.

So this approach seems to work. But why? Because the sum after adding each element is a triangular number starting from 3:

3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, etc. None of these are perfect squares.

Wait, but are any of these triangular numbers perfect squares? Let's check.

Triangular numbers are T(k) = k(k+1)/2.

Check for T(3) = 6 → no.

T(4) =10 → no.

T(5)=15 → no.

T(6)=21 → no.

T(7)=28 → no.

T(8)=36 → yes, 6^2. So for k=8, T(8)=36, which is a square. So for n=8, this approach would fail. Because the sum after 8 elements would be 36, which is a square. But wait, the total sum is n(n+1)/2. For n=8, the total sum is 36, which is a square, so the code would output -1. So the code's first check for the total sum being a square would catch this case. So the code would correctly output -1 for n=8.

So for the cases where the total sum is not a square, the approach of starting with [2,1] followed by 3,4,...n in order seems to work.

But let's check for n=8. The total sum is 36, which is a square. So code returns -1. Correct.

Another test case: n=6.

Total sum is 21 → not a square. So code would generate [2,1,3,4,5,6]. Sums are:

2 → ok.

3 → ok.

6 → ok.

10 → ok.

15 → ok.

21 → ok. All non-squares. Correct.

n=7: sum is 28, which is not a square. So code generates [2,1,3,4,5,6,7]. Sums are all non-squares. Correct.

But for n=7, the previous code's approach was to append numbers in reverse order, which caused a sum of 16 at step 4. So the new approach of appending in increasing order after 2 and 1 seems better.

So the correct code should construct the permutation as follows:

For n >= 2 and the total sum is not a square:

If n == 2: [2,1]

Else: [2, 1] followed by 3,4,...,n in order.

Let's see:

This would work for all n where the total sum is not a square.

Let's check for n=7:

Permutation is [2,1,3,4,5,6,7]. Sums are 2,3,6,10,15,21,28. All non-squares.

Another test case: n=3 → [2,1,3]. Sums 2,3,6. All ok.

n=4 → [2,1,3,4]. Sums 2,3,6,10. All ok.

So this approach seems correct.

So the error in the previous code was that it appended the remaining numbers in reverse order, which for some cases (like n=7) led to a sum that is a square. But by appending the numbers in increasing order after [2,1], we avoid this problem.

So the correct code is:

Check if n is 1 → output -1.

Check if total sum is square → output -1.

Else, output [2,1] followed by 3,4,...,n in order.

So modifying the code accordingly.

Let's check the sample inputs:

Sample input 4:

n=4, permutation is [2,1,3,4]. Sums are 2,3,6,10. All non-squares. But the sample output is [2,4,1,3]. But the problem allows any valid permutation, so this is also correct.

Sample input 5:

n=5, code output would be [2,1,3,4,5]. Let's check sums:

2 → ok.

3 → ok.

6 → ok.

10 → ok.

15 → ok. Which matches the required conditions.

But the sample output is [5,1,4,3,2]. Both are valid.

So the code should be adjusted to generate [2,1,3,4,5,..n] for n>2.

So the previous code's mistake was adding the numbers in reverse order after [2,1]. Instead, they should be added in increasing order.

So the corrected code would be:

For n>2:

ans = [2, 1] + list(range(3, n+1))

So for n=4, it's [2,1,3,4].

Which is correct.

Thus, the code should be modified to append the numbers from 3 to n in order.

Let me adjust the code accordingly.
