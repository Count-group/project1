Okay, I need to solve this problem where, for each node u in a tree, when it's removed, the tree breaks into several components. The task is to find the minimum coins needed to reconnect these components using the given operation. The operation allows adding edges between pairs of nodes, paying the sum of their weights, and then each of those nodes' weights increases by 1 for future operations.

Let me start by understanding the problem better. When we remove node u, the tree splits into k components, where k is the degree of u. To connect them back, we need k-1 edges. Each edge added requires two nodes. So, for k-1 edges, we need 2*(k-1) node selections. But since each node can be used multiple times, but each time their cost increases, the order and selection of nodes matter.

Wait, the problem states that when you choose u and v, you pay their current w_u + w_v, and then each of them increases by 1. So, for each subsequent use of a node, its cost is higher by 1 each time.

This makes the problem more complex because the optimal strategy would be to use the smallest possible nodes as many times as possible, but each time they are used, they become more expensive. So, the first time you use a node with weight w, it costs w. The next time, it's w+1, then w+2, etc.

But how do we model this? Let's think about the total cost when a node is used t times. The total cost contributions from that node would be w + (w+1) + (w+2) + ... + (w + t-1) = t*w + t*(t-1)/2. So, the sum for t uses is t*w + t(t-1)/2.

So, the problem reduces to selecting nodes in such a way that we have 2*(k-1) node usages (since each edge contributes two nodes), and the sum of their individual sequences (each t_i being the number of times a node is used) is minimized.

But how do we choose which nodes to use and how many times?

The optimal approach is to use the smallest possible nodes as many times as possible. Because using a smaller node multiple times might be better than using a larger node once. For example, a node with w=1 used twice would contribute 1 + 2 = 3, whereas a node with w=2 once contributes 2. So in this case, using the smaller node twice is better.

So the strategy is to pick the m smallest nodes (where m is 2*(k-1)), but considering that using a node multiple times adds to the cost each time. However, when m exceeds the number of available nodes (n-1, since u is excluded), we need to reuse some nodes multiple times.

Wait, the problem says that when u is broken, we can choose any nodes except u (since u is removed). So the available nodes are the other n-1 nodes. So if we need to select 2*(k-1) nodes, but n-1 may be less than that. For example, if k-1 is large, like if u is a high-degree node, then 2*(k-1) might be greater than n-1. In that case, some nodes have to be used multiple times.

So the problem splits into two cases:

1. If m = 2*(k-1) ≤ (n-1): Then we can select the m smallest nodes (each used once), sum their initial weights. Total cost is sum of the m smallest weights.

Wait, no. Because even if m is ≤ n-1, but maybe using some nodes multiple times gives a lower total cost. Wait, no. For example, suppose m=3, and n-1 is 3. The best is to pick the three smallest nodes once each. But if m=4 and n-1=3, then we have to pick one node twice. So for the general case, the approach is to select the s =n-1 smallest nodes (sorted by initial weight), and then for the remaining (m - s) uses, we take the smallest node again, increasing each time.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Let's consider that when we have to select m nodes (with possible repeats), the optimal way is to take the s smallest nodes (sorted in ascending order), and then for the first (m - s) times, take the smallest node again, each time increasing its weight by 1. But since each use increases the weight, the order of selection matters. However, since all uses are for edges, the exact order may not matter, but the total sum is the sum of the first m elements in a multiset where each of the s smallest nodes is available, and each subsequent use of a node adds 1 to its weight.

Wait, perhaps a better way to model this is to imagine that after choosing the s smallest nodes once, the next step is to use the smallest node again (now with weight+1), then again (weight+2), etc. So the total sum would be the sum of the s smallest nodes, plus the sum of the first (m-s) terms of the sequence 1, 2, 3, ... (each term representing the incremental cost of reusing the smallest node).

But how to compute this sum?

For example, if s = 3 nodes, m=5. The sum would be sum of the three smallest nodes (each once), then the smallest node is used two more times, adding (w_1 +1) and (w_1 + 2). So the total sum is sum_initial + (w_1 +1) + (w_1 +2) = sum_initial + 2*w_1 + 3.

Alternatively, the sum can be represented as sum_initial + sum_{i=1 to t} (w_min + i), where t is (m - s). But that's only if the minimal node is chosen each time.

So, the general approach is:

1. For the given u, compute m = 2*(k-1), where k is the degree of u.

2. Compute the sum of the first m terms in the sequence formed by taking the sorted list of the n-1 nodes (excluding u) and then for any terms beyond the (n-1)th term, each subsequent term is the smallest node's weight plus the number of times it's been used so far.

But how to compute this efficiently for all u?

The key steps are:

- Pre-sort the list of all nodes except u, for each u.

But for n up to 1e6, precomputing this for each u is impossible due to O(n^2) time and memory. So, we need a smarter way.

Alternative approach:

The sum for each u is based on the m smallest elements of the sorted list (excluding u), but considering that if m exceeds the available nodes (s = n-1), then some nodes are reused.

But how can we model the sum for each u?

Let me think: The minimal sum is the sum of the first m elements in the sequence generated by taking the sorted list (excluding u) and appending elements by increasing the smallest element each time.

But the sequence can be thought of as:

sorted_list = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_s] (sorted in ascending order)

Then, for m > s, the next elements are a_1 +1, a_1 +2, ..., a_1 + (m - s).

So the sum is sum(sorted_list) + sum_{i=1 to (m - s)} (a_1 + i)

But wait, for even more elements, like m-s is larger than a_2 - a_1, perhaps it's better to take a_2 first. No, because a_1 is the smallest, so using it as much as possible is optimal.

For example, if a_1=1, a_2=3. When m-s is 2, the sum would be 1+2 (since 1 is used twice more, each time adding 1). But if we took a_2 once, it's 3, which is more than 1+2=3. So same sum here. But for m-s=3: 1+2+3=6 versus 3 + ...?

Hmm, in this case, 1+2+3=6 is better than 3+1+2=6. So the approach holds.

Thus, the sum for m elements is:

If m <= s: sum of the first m elements of sorted_list.

If m > s: sum of all s elements, plus sum of (a_1) + (a_1 +1) + ... + (a_1 + (m-s-1)).

But how do we compute this for each u?

We need to find:

- The sum of the first m elements of the sorted list of nodes excluding u, but if m exceeds s (s is n-1, since we exclude u), then sum all s elements plus the sum of the first (m-s) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting at a_1 (the smallest in the sorted list) with step 1.

So for each u, we need:

1. The sum of the first m elements of the sorted list (excluding u) if m <= s (s = n-1).

2. If m > s: sum of all s elements plus the sum from 0 to (m-s-1) of (a_1 + i) = (m-s)*a_1 + ( (m-s-1)*(m-s) ) / 2.

But how to compute this efficiently for all u?

The challenge is that for each u, the sorted list is all nodes except u. So for each u, we need the sum of the first m elements of the sorted list (excluding u), and the minimal element a_1 in that list.

But for n=1e6, precomputing for each u the sum of the first m elements is not feasible unless we have an efficient way.

Let me think. The global sorted list is the sorted list of all nodes. For each u, when we exclude it, the sorted list is the global list minus one occurrence of w[u]. So for example, if in the global list, the elements are [1,1,2,3], and u has w=1, then the sorted list excluding u is [1,2,3].

So the idea is to precompute the global sorted list, and for each u, determine how many elements are less than w[u], equal to w[u], etc., so that we can compute the sum of the first m elements excluding u.

But how?

Let me think about the following:

The global sorted list is S.

For a given u, the sorted list after excluding one occurrence of w[u] is S', which is S minus one occurrence of w[u].

To find the sum of the first m elements in S', we can:

- Find the position where w[u] is in S. Let's say in S, there are 'cnt' occurrences of w[u]. So in S', the count is cnt-1.

But when we take the first m elements of S', which is S with one occurrence of w[u] removed.

So the approach is to:

1. For each u, compute how many elements in the global list are less than w[u], equal to w[u], and greater than w[u].

Then, the first m elements in S' can consist of:

- All elements in S that are less than w[u], up to their count.

- Then, as many elements equal to w[u] as possible, but subtracting one (since one occurrence is removed).

- Then elements greater than w[u].

So for example, let's say in S, there are 'less' elements < w[u], 'eq' elements == w[u], and 'great' elements > w[u].

In S', the elements are:

less elements < w[u], then (eq-1) elements == w[u], then great elements > w[u].

So when we take the first m elements of S', they consist of:

- The first 'min(less, m)' elements from the < w[u] group.

- Then, if there are remaining elements needed (after taking all less elements), take up to (eq-1) elements from the == w[u] group.

- Then, if still more elements needed, take from the > w[u] group.

The sum of these elements is the sum of the first min(less, m) elements in S (the < w[u] part) plus the sum of the next min(remaining, eq-1) elements (which are all equal to w[u]) plus the sum of the next elements from the > w[u] part.

But how can we compute this efficiently for each u?

We can precompute the prefix sums of the global sorted list S. Then, for a given u:

- Find the number of elements less than w[u] (using bisect_left), call it 'less'.

- The number of elements equal to w[u] is 'eq = bisect_right - bisect_left'.

Then, the sum for the first m elements in S' would be:

sum = prefix[min(less, m)]

remaining = m - min(less, m)

if remaining > 0:

sum += w[u] * min(remaining, eq - 1)

remaining -= min(remaining, eq -1)

if remaining >0:

sum += prefix[less + eq + remaining] - prefix[less + eq]

So this gives the sum of the first m elements in S', excluding u.

But then, for the case when m > s (s = n-1), which is when 2*(k-1) > n-1, we need to compute the sum of all s elements plus the sum of the arithmetic sequence.

But s = n-1, because after removing u, there are n-1 nodes. So m = 2*(k-1) can be up to 2*(n-1 -1) (if u has degree n-1, but that's not possible in a tree). Wait, in a tree, the maximum degree is n-1 (for a star-shaped tree). So in that case, k would be n-1, so m = 2*(n-2). But s = n-1 (since u is removed). So for example, if n is 6, then s =5, m=2*(5-1) =8. So 8>5, so need to compute sum of 5 elements (all) plus 3 terms of the arithmetic sequence starting at the minimal element (a_1) with step 1.

But how to get a_1 (the minimal element in S')? That's the first element in S', which is the same as the first element in S unless the first element was u. So for example, if u has w[u] = the global minimum, then S' is S with one occurrence of the global minimum removed. So the new a_1 is the next occurrence.

So for a_1 in S', we can determine it as follows:

If S has elements where some are less than w[u], then the minimal element in S' is the same as in S.

If all elements in S are >= w[u], then after removing one occurrence of w[u], the minimal element is the next smallest in S. For example, if S is [1,1,2,3], and u has w=1, then S' is [1,2,3], so a_1 is 1.

But if u's w is the minimal, then S' has one less occurrence of the minimal, but others may still be present.

So the a_1 in S' is the minimal element of S if S has elements less than w[u], else it's the minimal of the remaining elements after removing one occurrence of w[u].

Alternatively, the a_1 is the minimal between the global minimal (if there are elements less than w[u]) and the remaining elements.

Wait, perhaps the minimal element in S' is the same as the global minimal unless all elements in S' are greater than or equal to the global minimal. For example, if the global minimal is 1, and u's w is 1. Then S' will have one less 1, but if there are other 1s, then a_1 is still 1. If all elements in S are 1, then after removing one, S' is all 1s except one, but that's not possible here because n >=2.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think of a way to compute the minimal element in S' (a_1) as follows:

The a_1 is the first element in the sorted list S', which is S with one occurrence of w[u] removed.

If S has elements smaller than w[u], then a_1 is the same as the first element of S.

If all elements in S are >= w[u], then the first element of S' is the first element of S, unless the first element was w[u], in which case, after removing one occurrence, if there are more, then it's still w[u], else the next element.

But how can we compute a_1 for S'?

Alternatively, the minimal element in S' is min(S_min, ... ), but perhaps the easiest way is:

If there are elements less than w[u] in S, then a_1 is S[0].

Otherwise, if the count of elements equal to w[u] in S is >=1 (since S' is S with one such element removed), then a_1 is w[u].

Otherwise, the elements are all greater than w[u], and a_1 is S[1] (since S' is S without S[0], which was w[u], but if that was the only occurrence, then S' has elements S[1..n-1], which are all greater than w[u}).

Wait, this seems complex. Let's try to model a_1 as:

If S has elements less than w[u], then a_1 is the first element of S (which is less than w[u}).

Else, if there are elements equal to w[u], then a_1 is w[u].

Else, a_1 is S[1] (since S[0] is w[u], but after removing one occurrence, S' has S[1] as the first element).

But how can we compute this for each u?

Alternatively, the a_1 in S' is the first element in the global sorted list S that is not the one occurrence of w[u] that we removed.

So, for example, if S has multiple instances of w[u], then S' will have one less instance, but the first element remains the same if there are elements smaller than w[u].

So the minimal a_1 in S' is S[0] if S[0] < w[u], else, if there are any elements in S equal to w[u], then the minimal a_1 is w[u]. Otherwise, it's S[1] (since S[0] was removed).

But this seems complicated. Perhaps the a_1 can be found as follows:

After removing one occurrence of w[u], the minimal element in S' is:

If S has elements less than w[u], then S[0] (which is less than w[u}).

Else, if there are at least two elements equal to w[u], then S' will have at least one, so the minimal is w[u].

Else, if there is exactly one element equal to w[u], then after removing it, the minimal element is the next element in S, which is greater than w[u}.

So, to compute a_1, we can:

- Check if there are elements less than w[u] in S. If yes, a_1 is S[0].

- Else, if the number of elements equal to w[u] in S is at least 1 (since we remove one), then a_1 is w[u}.

- Else, a_1 is S[1} (since S[0} was w[u], which was removed, and the remaining elements are S[1..n-1}).

But how to compute this?

This seems manageable with binary search.

Let me outline the steps for each u:

1. Compute the sorted list S (all nodes).

2. Compute the prefix sums of S.

3. For each u:

   a. Find the number of elements less than w[u} (using bisect_left), called 'less'.

   b. Find the number of elements equal to w[u} (bisect_right - bisect_left), called 'eq'.

   c. The number of elements in S' is n-1 (since we exclude u).

   d. For S', the elements are:

      - The first 'less' elements (all less than w[u}).

      - Then 'eq-1' elements equal to w[u}.

      - Then the elements greater than w[u}.

   e. The sum of the first m elements in S' is computed as:

      sum_less = sum of first min(less, m) elements.

      remaining = m - min(less, m).

      sum_eq = sum of up to (eq-1) elements of value w[u} multiplied by min(remaining, eq-1).

      remaining -= min(remaining, eq-1).

      sum_greater = sum of elements from S[less + eq ... less + eq + remaining -1} (i.e., the next 'remaining' elements greater than w[u}).

      total_sum = sum_less + sum_eq + sum_greater.

      If m exceeds the number of elements in S' (n-1), then:

         total_sum = sum of all elements in S' + sum of an arithmetic sequence starting at a_1, with step 1, for (m - (n-1)) terms.

   f. So the minimal a_1 is needed for the case when m exceeds (n-1).

But how to compute a_1?

As per earlier discussion, a_1 is:

   - If less > 0: a_1 = S[0}.

   - else if eq >=1: a_1 = w[u}.

   - else: a_1 = S[1} (since S[0} is w[u} and we removed one occurrence).

But how to determine if there are elements less than w[u} in S.

Alternatively, a_1 can be found as:

If S[0} < w[u}: a_1 is S[0}.

Else if eq > 0: a_1 is S[0} (since S[0} is w[u} and there are others, so after removing one, there's at least one left).

Else: a_1 is S[1} (since S[0} was w[u}, which is removed, and the next element is S[1}).

Wait, no. If S[0} is equal to w[u}, and eq is 1 (so after removing one, there's none left), then the next elements are S[1}, which may be greater than w[u}.

So:

a_1 is:

if less >0: S[0} (since there are elements less than w[u} in S').

else:

   if (eq -1) >= 1: then a_1 is w[u} (since there are still elements equal to w[u} in S').

   else: a_1 is the first element in S after the removed element.

But how to find this first element after removal?

For example:

S = [1,2,2,3], u's w=2.

Original S has elements [1,2,2,3]. S' is [1,2,3}.

Here, a_1 is 1, which is S[0}.

If u's w=1, and S is [1,1,2,3}, then S' is [1,2,3}, a_1 is 1.

If u's w=1 and S is [1,2,3}, then S' is [2,3}, a_1 is 2.

So in this case:

less is 0 (since no elements in S are less than w[u}=1).

eq is 1 (bisect_left=0, bisect_right=1, so eq=1). So eq-1=0.

So after removing one occurrence of w[u}, there are 0 elements equal to w[u} left.

Thus, the next elements are S[1..n-1} = [2,3}, so a_1 is 2.

So the logic is:

if less >0: a_1 = S[0} (since some elements are less than w[u} in S').

else:

   if (eq -1) >= 1: then a_1 is w[u} (there are still elements equal to w[u} in S').

   else: the first element in S' is S[less + (eq -1) + 1} = S[less + eq}].

Wait, perhaps the way to compute a_1 is:

If less >0, then a_1 is S[0}.

Else:

   if (eq >= 1 and (eq-1) >= 1) --> eq >=2: then a_1 is w[u}.

   else: a_1 is S[1} if S[0} == w[u} and eq ==1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think in terms of the global sorted list S and the parameters less and eq.

If less >0: a_1 is S[0}.

Else:

   if (eq >=1) and (eq -1 >= 1) → eq >=2: then S' has at least one element equal to w[u}, so a_1 is w[u}.

   else:

      if S has any elements after the removed one, then a_1 is the first element in S after the removed one.

So for example:

Case 1: less=0, eq=3.

After removing one, eq-1=2, so S' has 2 elements equal to w[u}, so a_1 = w[u}.

Case 2: less=0, eq=1. After removing one, eq-1=0. So S' consists of elements greater than w[u} (since less=0). So a_1 is the first element in S after the first occurrence of w[u}.

But how to find that in the global sorted list?

The global sorted list is S. After removing one occurrence of w[u} (which is at position less), the next elements are S[less+1 ... n-1}.

So the first element of S' is S[0} if less>0.

Else, after removing one occurrence, the first element is:

If eq >=1, then the first occurrence is at index 0. So removing one gives us (eq-1) elements of w[u}. So if eq-1 >=1, then the first element is w[u}.

Else, the first element is S[1} (assuming we have elements after the first one).

But how to compute this in code?

Alternatively, the a_1 for S' is:

if less >0 → S[0}.

else:

   if (eq >=1):

      if (eq -1) >=1 → a_1 is w[u}.

      else → a_1 is S[ less + eq ] (since after removing the first occurrence, the next elements are from S[ less + eq ... ].

   else:

      a_1 is S[ less + eq ].

But this seems possible.

So to compute a_1:

less = bisect_left(S, w_u)

eq = bisect_right(S, w_u) - less

if less >0:

    a1 = S[0]

else:

    if eq >=1:

        if eq >1:

            a1 = w_u

        else:

            if len(S) > (less + eq):

                a1 = S[less + eq]

            else:

                # but S' has n-1 elements, which is >=1 since u is removed and n>=2.

                # So after removing one w_u, there are no more w_u left. So S' starts with S[less + 1 ...]

                a1 = S[1] if less ==0 and eq ==1.

    else:

        a1 = S[less + eq]

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since S is sorted, the first occurrence of w_u is at index less. After removing one occurrence, the elements in S' are:

All elements less than w_u, then (eq-1) elements equal to w_u, then elements greater than w_u.

So the first element of S' is:

- If there are elements less than w_u, then S[0].

- Else, if there are any elements equal to w_u left (i.e., eq-1 >=1), then the first element is w_u.

- Else, the first element is S[ less + eq ].

Thus, the a_1 can be calculated as:

if less >0:

    a1 = S[0]

elif eq >1:

    a1 = w_u

else:

    if (less + eq) < len(S):

        a1 = S[less + eq]

    else:

        # this can't happen, because after removing u, there are n-1 elements.

        # but len(S) is n, after removing one, len(S') is n-1.

        # So (less + eq) could be up to len(S) -1.

        # But in the else case, where less ==0, eq <=1.

        # if eq ==1, then after removing one, S' has elements from S[1 ... n-1}.

        # So a_1 = S[1}.

        a1 = S[1]

Thus, in code, for a given u:

w_u = w[u-1]

less = bisect.bisect_left(S, w_u)

eq = bisect.bisect_right(S, w_u) - less

if less >0:

    a1 = S[0]

else:

    if eq -1 >=1:

        a1 = w_u

    else:

        if less + eq < len(S):

            a1 = S[less + eq]

        else:

            a1 = S[1]  # when len(S) is 1, but that's impossible because n >=2.

But this may not cover all cases. For example, when S has elements [2,2,3], and u's w is 2.

Then, less =0, eq=2. After removing one, eq-1=1 >=1. So a1 is 2.

Which is correct.

Another example: S = [1,1,2], u's w=1.

less =0, eq=2. After removing one, eq-1=1 >=1. So a1 is 1.

Another example: S = [1], but n >=2. This is impossible.

So, putting this together, the steps are:

For each u:

Compute k = degree[u]

If k <=1: answer is 0.

Else:

m = 2*(k-1)

s = n-1 (since excluding u)

if m ==0: answer 0.

else:

compute the sum of the first m elements in S' (sorted list excluding u).

If m <= s:

sum = sum of first m elements in S'.

Else:

sum_all_s = sum of all s elements in S'.

additional = m - s

a1 is the minimal element in S'.

sum_additional = a1 * additional + additional * (additional-1) // 2

total_sum = sum_all_s + sum_additional

So the total cost is total_sum.

Now, the challenge is to compute sum of first m elements in S' when m <=s, and sum_all_s when m >s, plus the arithmetic series.

To compute sum of first m elements in S' when m <=s, we can use the approach with the prefix sums and the parameters less and eq.

Similarly, sum_all_s is sum(S) - w_u.

Thus, the plan is:

Precompute the global sorted list S and its prefix sums.

For each u:

1. Compute w_u = w[u-1]

2. Compute k = degree[u]

   if k <=1: output 0.

   else:

      m = 2*(k-1)

      s = n-1

      if m > s:

          sum_all_s = sum(S) - w_u

          additional = m - s

          compute a1 as per the rules.

          sum_additional = a1 * additional + additional * (additional -1) // 2

          total = sum_all_s + sum_additional

      else:

          compute sum_first_m = sum of first m elements in S'

          total = sum_first_m

      output total.

Thus, the crux of the problem is to compute sum_first_m for m <=s and a1 when m>s.

But how to compute sum_first_m for each u?

This can be done using the prefix sums and the parameters less, eq.

For sum_first_m when m <=s (s=n-1):

sum_first_m is the sum of:

min(less, m) elements from the less than w_u group.

then, min(remaining, eq-1) elements from the eq-1 group (all w_u).

then, min(remaining_after_eq, elements in the greater group) elements from the greater group.

But how to compute this sum.

The code for sum_first_m is:

sum = 0

remaining = m

# take from less group

take_less = min(less, remaining)

sum += prefix[take_less]

remaining -= take_less

if remaining >0:

    # take from eq-1 group

    take_eq = min(eq-1, remaining)

    sum += w_u * take_eq

    remaining -= take_eq

if remaining >0:

    # take from greater group, starting at index less + eq in S (since in S', after less and eq-1 elements)

    start = less + eq

    sum += prefix[start + remaining] - prefix[start]

Thus, sum_first_m is this sum.

But this requires knowing the prefix sums of the global sorted list S.

Now, the code for the entire solution:

Read n.

Read w as a list.

Read the edges, compute degree for each node.

Sort the global list S of w.

Compute the prefix sums.

For each u:

   if degree[u] <=1:

      print 0

      continue

   else:

      m = 2*(degree[u]-1)

      s =n-1

      if m ==0:

          print 0

          continue

      w_u = w[u-1]

      less = bisect.bisect_left(S, w_u)

      eq = bisect.bisect_right(S, w_u) - less

      if m <= s:

          take_less = min(less, m)

          sum_part = prefix[take_less]

          remaining = m - take_less

          if remaining >0:

              take_eq = min(eq-1, remaining)

              sum_part += w_u * take_eq

              remaining -= take_eq

          if remaining >0:

              start = less + eq

              sum_part += prefix[start + remaining] - prefix[start]

          total = sum_part

      else:

          sum_all_s = prefix[n] - w_u  # sum of S is prefix[n], and S' is sum_all_s.

          # compute a1

          if less >0:

              a1 = S[0]

          else:

              if (eq -1) >=1:

                  a1 = w_u

              else:

                  # find the first element after removing one occurrence of w_u.

                  if less + eq < len(S):

                      a1 = S[less + eq]

                  else:

                      # this case should not happen as s =n-1 and m>s implies s >=0, but u can't be the only node.

                      a1 = S[1]

          additional = m - s

          sum_additional = a1 * additional + additional * (additional -1) // 2

          total = sum_all_s + sum_additional

      print(total, end=' ')

But what about when u's w is present in the global list, and how the sum_all_s is computed?

Wait, sum_all_s is the sum of all elements in S', which is sum(S) - w_u.

Because S is the sorted list of all w, and S' is S minus one occurrence of w_u.

Yes, sum_all_s = sum(S) - w_u.

But sum(S) is prefix[n].

So that part is correct.

Now, let's test this logic with the sample input.

Sample Input:

6

1 1 1 1 1 1

Edges:

1-2

1-3

1-4

2-5

2-6

So the tree is:

1 is connected to 2,3,4.

2 is connected to 5,6.

So the degrees:

node 1: degree 3 (connected to 2,3,4).

node 2: degree 3 (connected to 1,5,6).

nodes 3,4,5,6: degree 1.

So for u=1:

degree is 3, m = 2*(3-1) =4.

s=6-1=5.

Since m=4 <=5:

sum_first_m is the first 4 elements in S', which is S sorted list minus one 1.

Global S is [1,1,1,1,1,1].

So S' is five 1's.

So sum_first_m is 1*4 =4.

So output is4.

For u=2:

degree is 3, m=4.

S is same as above, S' is five 1's.

sum_first_m is4 → output4.

For u=3, degree 1 → output0.

Which matches the sample output.

So the code should handle this case.

But let's see how the code computes sum_first_m.

For u=1:

w_u =1.

less = bisect_left(S, 1) → 0.

eq =6 (bisect_right is6).

So:

take_less = min(0,4) →0.

sum_part=0.

remaining=4.

take_eq = min(6-1,4) →5 and4. take_eq=4.

sum_part += 1 *4=4.

remaining=0.

So sum_part=4.

Total=4.

Which is correct.

So the code works for this case.

Another test case: when m exceeds s.

Suppose n=3, nodes have weights [1,2,3]. u is node 1. Degree is 2. m=2*(2-1)=2. s=2.

m=2 <=s=2. So sum_first_m is sum of S' which is [2,3]. sum=5. But what if u is node 1, which has w=1. S' is [2,3]. sum_first_m=2+3=5.

But if degree is 3, then m=2*(3-1)=4. s=2 (n-1=3-1=2). So m=4> s=2.

sum_all_s=2+3=5.

additional=4-2=2.

a1 is S'[0}=2.

sum_additional =2*2 + (2*1)/2=4+1=5.

Total=5+5=10.

Which would be the correct sum.

The code should compute this correctly.

Now, let's look at the previous code that was generated and see where it might have gone wrong.

The previous code tried to handle the case when m exceeds s by calculating q and r, but perhaps there was a mistake in the approach.

The new approach, as outlined, should correctly compute the sum for all cases.

Thus, the code needs to be rewritten following this logic.

Now, translating the above plan into Python code.

The steps are:

1. Read input.

2. Compute the degree of each node.

3. Sort the global list of weights.

4. Compute prefix sums.

5. For each u:

   a. If degree[u] <=1: output0.

   b. Else, compute m=2*(degree[u]-1).

   c. If m > s (n-1):

      i. sum_all_s = sum(S) - w[u-1].

      ii. Compute a1 of S'.

      iii. Compute additional = m - s.

      iv. sum_additional = a1*additional + additional*(additional-1)//2.

      v. total = sum_all_s + sum_additional.

   d. Else:

      i. Compute sum_first_m using the prefix sums and the bisect parameters.

   e. Output total.

Thus, the code should be:

Implementing this in Python, handling the computation of a1 correctly.

Let me write the code accordingly.
