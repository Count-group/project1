Okay, let's see. The problem is about counting the number of valid sequences of operations where after each step, P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct. So after each step, at least two of them must be equal. And each step, you have to choose one of the three variables to XOR with the current element.

Hmm. The initial approach with dynamic programming using states where all three are equal (state A) and where two are equal (state B) seems right. But the previous code wasn't passing all test cases. Let's think through the sample inputs to find where the mistake might be.

Looking at the first sample input:

3
1 7 9

The output is 3. Which means the only valid sequences are choosing the same variable each time (PPP, QQQ, RRR). So after each step, all three variables are equal. Because if you choose different variables, after the first step, P, Q, R would be 1, 0, 0. Then in the next steps, maybe they could diverge, but according to the sample, those are the only valid options. So perhaps the code isn't handling transitions correctly when elements are non-zero.

Let's look at the code for non-zero elements. When processing a non-zero element:

In the code, when the current element is not zero, transitions from state A (all equal) would add 3 * dpA to newB[num]. Then, transitions from state B (two equal) would involve XORing the third variable (s ^ num) and adding that to newB. Also, if s == num, then adding 2 * cnt to newB[s], which would represent assigning to one of the two equal variables.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the transitions from state B when the current element is non-zero. Let's think: in state B, two variables are equal, and the third is s. So for example, P=Q, R = s. Then, when processing a new element a_i, there are three choices:

1. Assign to P: new P is P ^ a_i, Q remains the same (since they were equal), R remains s. So now P and Q are different (since P changed), but Q and R would be equal only if Q == s. But wait, after XORing P, new P is P XOR a_i. But original P and Q were equal. So new P is different from Q. So then, after this assignment, P is now different from Q. R is s, which was different from P and Q before. So after this, perhaps P is different from Q, but maybe R equals Q? Not sure. Wait, in state B, two variables are equal. Let's say P=Q, R is different. So P=Q = x, R = s. Then, when you XOR P with a_i, P becomes x ^ a_i. Q is still x. R is s. So now, P != Q, and R is s. For this to be valid (all three not pairwise distinct), there must be at least two equal. But now, after XORing P, we have P=x^a_i, Q=x, R=s. Are any two equal? Only if x^a_i equals x (which would require a_i=0, but this is the non-zero case) or x^a_i equals s. But in the code's transition, how is this handled?

Wait, the code's transition for state B when processing a non-zero element:

For each s in dpB:

- Assigning to the third variable (the one that's different): XOR s with a_i. So new state would have two variables equal (the other two) and the third being s ^ a_i. But since the other two were equal (P=Q), if we assign to R (third variable), then new R is s ^ a_i. Then, the new state is P=Q=x, R = s ^ a_i. So this is state B with the new s being s ^ a_i. The count is added to newB[new_s].

- Assigning to one of the equal variables (say P): then P becomes x ^ a_i. Q is still x, R is s. Now, for this new state to be valid (all three not pairwise distinct), there must be two equal. So either Q == R (x == s) or P equals Q (which would require x ^a_i == x → a_i=0, which is not the case here) or P equals R (x^a_i == s). 

Wait, but in the code's transition, when processing a non-zero element in state B, the code checks if s == num. Then, adding 2 * cnt to newB[s]. But why?

Let me think. Suppose in state B, the two equal variables are x, x, and the third is s. So when we process a_i = s. Assigning to one of the two equal variables (P or Q) would change x to x ^ s. So new P is x ^ s, Q remains x. Then, after this step, the variables are x ^ s, x, and s. Are any two equal here? Let's see: x ^ s and x would be equal only if s is 0, but a_i is s and non-zero here. So x ^ s and x are different. But R is s. So P and R would be x^s and s. Are they equal? Only if x^s = s → x=0. But in state B, x and s are different (since two variables are equal and one is different). So unless x is zero and s is something else. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe this logic is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's transition for state B when assigning to one of the equal variables and the current a_i equals the third variable's value (s) would result in the two variables becoming equal to s. For example:

Original state B: P=Q=x, R=s. Assign a_i (which is s) to P. Then new P is x^s. Q is x. R is s. Now, for this to be a valid state (all three not pairwise distinct), there must be two that are equal. Suppose x ^ s equals s. Then x^s = s → x = 0. Then P becomes s, Q is 0. R is s. So P and R are equal. So the new state would have two variables equal (P and R), and Q is 0. So this is a state B with s = 0. But how is this handled in the code?

Alternatively, if a_i is equal to s, then when we assign to one of the equal variables (x), we have new variable x ^ s. Then, the new variables are x^s (P), x (Q), s (R). For this to be a valid state, two must be equal. Let's see when that can happen.

If x^s == x → s=0, but a_i is non-zero. So no. If x^s == s → x=0. Then P becomes 0^s = s, Q is 0, R is s. So P and R are s, Q is 0. So two variables are equal (P and R), which is state B with s being 0. So this transition would be allowed if x is 0. But how do we track this in the code?

The code's logic for when s == num (a_i) is adding 2*cnt to newB[s]. But in this case, after the assignment, the new state would have the two variables (like P and R) equal to s, and Q is x (0). So the new state's s would be x (0), not the original s. So perhaps the code is incorrect here.

Wait, perhaps the code's transition for state B when a_i is s is incorrect. Let's re-examine:

For each s in dpB:

When processing num (a_i), if we assign to one of the two equal variables (like P or Q), which were x, x. Then, after XOR with num, which is s, P becomes x ^ s. Now, the new state would have two variables equal if x ^ s equals the third variable (s) or x ^ s equals the other variable (Q, which is x).

So x ^ s == s → x = 0. In that case, the new variables are s, 0, s. So P and R are s, Q is 0. So the new state is two variables equal (P and R) with third variable 0. So in the state B, the key is 0, and the count would be added. But in the code, when s (original third variable) is equal to num (s), the code adds 2 * cnt to newB[s]. But in this case, the new third variable (Q) is 0. So the code is adding to newB[s], which would be the same as the original s, but that's incorrect.

Ah! So the code's logic here is wrong. When you assign to one of the two equal variables (x) when a_i is s (equal to the third variable), then the new state's third variable (the one that's different) would be x. Because after XORing x with s (which is the third variable), if x is 0, then the new variables are s (P), 0 (Q), s (R). So the two variables (P and R) are s, and Q is 0. So in state B, the key is 0, not s. So the code's approach of adding to newB[s] (original s) is incorrect.

So the code's current transition for state B when num is s is adding 2 * cnt to newB[s], but that's not correct. Instead, when x is 0, the new third variable is 0, so the key should be 0, not s. Therefore, the code is incorrect here.

So how to fix this?

The mistake is in handling the case where we assign to one of the two equal variables when the current a_i is equal to the third variable's value (s). The code assumes that this would contribute to newB[s], but in reality, the new third variable is x (the original x), which may be 0. So this requires that x is 0 for the assignment to create a valid state. But x is the value of the two equal variables in state B.

Wait, in state B, the two equal variables are x and x, and the third is s. So when we process a_i = s, and choose to assign to one of the two equal variables (x), the new value is x ^ s. For this to result in a valid state (two variables equal), there are two possibilities:

1. The new value x ^ s equals s. Which implies x is 0. Then, the new variables are 0 ^ s = s, x (0), s. So two variables are s, one is 0. The third variable (the one that's different) is 0. So in this case, the new state is state B with s' = 0. So the code should add to newB[0], not newB[s].

2. The new value x ^ s equals x. Which implies s is 0. But in this case, a_i is s and non-zero, so this can't happen.

So the code's current approach, which checks if s == num, and then adds 2 * cnt to newB[s], is incorrect. Instead, when s == num, the only valid transition is when x is 0. But in state B, x is the value of the two equal variables, and s is the third variable (which is different from x). So x can't be equal to s. So x is something else.

Wait, in state B, the two equal variables are x and x, and the third variable is s. So x != s. Because otherwise, all three would be equal (if x = s), but that's state A.

So when we are in state B, x and s are different. So if we assign a_i = s to one of the equal variables (x), then the new value is x ^ s. For this new value to equal the third variable (s), we need x ^ s = s → x = 0. Then, the new variables are s (from x ^ s), x (0), and s (third variable). So two variables are s (the first and third), and the third variable is 0. So the new state is state B with the third variable being 0. So in this case, the code should add to newB[0], but only if x was 0. But x is the value of the two equal variables in state B, which can be anything except s.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe the code's approach to this part is wrong. Let's re-express the transitions.

When in state B, where two variables are x, and the third is s (x != s):

For the current a_i = num:

Option 1: Assign to the third variable (s). Then the new third variable is s ^ num. So the new state is B with s' = s ^ num. The count is added to newB[s'].

Option 2: Assign to one of the two equal variables (x). The new value is x ^ num. Then, the two variables that were equal (x, x) become x ^ num and x. For the new state to be valid, at least two variables must be equal. So possible cases:

- x ^ num == x → num must be 0. But in this case, we are handling non-zero num, so this can't happen.

- x ^ num == s (the third variable). Then, x ^ num = s → x = s ^ num. But the current s is the third variable, and in state B, x != s. So if this condition is met, then the new value x ^ num equals s, making the third variable equal to one of the two variables. So the new state would have two variables (the modified one and the third variable) equal, and the other variable (the other original x) as the third. So in this case, the new state is B with s' = x (the unmodified variable).

Wait, for example:

Original state: P=Q=x, R=s (x != s).

Assign to P: new P is x ^ num. Q is x, R is s.

For the new state to be valid, two variables must be equal. So possible scenarios:

1. x ^ num == x → num is 0 (invalid here).

2. x ^ num == s → then P and R are equal. So the new state is P and R equal to s, Q is x. So the two equal variables are P and R (s), and the third is Q (x). So in state B, the third variable is x. So the new key in dpB is x. So the count is added to newB[x].

So in this case, the transition is allowed only if x ^ num == s.

So, in the code, for each s in dpB and each a_i=num:

When assigning to one of the two equal variables (x), the new variables are x^num, x, s. For this to be a valid state, we need x^num == s. Then, the new state is B with s' = x. So we add to newB[x] the count multiplied by 2 (since there are two variables to choose to assign to: P or Q).

So the code needs to check if x^num equals s. But wait, in the state B, the two equal variables are x, x, and the third is s. So x is not equal to s. So when processing a_i=num, when assigning to x, the new value is x^num. For this to equal the third variable s, x^num must equal s. Then, the new state is B with s' = x (the other variable).

But how do we track x here? Because in the code's current structure, the state B is tracked with the third variable's value (s), but x is the value of the two equal variables. So for each entry in dpB, the key is s, but x is the same for all entries in the same state. Wait, no. Because dpB is a dictionary where the key is s (the third variable), but for each s, there could be multiple x values that led to this s. So how does the code track x?

Wait, perhaps the code's approach is not tracking x. This is the crux of the problem. Because in state B, when two variables are equal, their value (x) is not tracked in the dpB. The dpB only tracks the third variable's value (s). So when processing a transition from state B, the code assumes that for each s in dpB, the two equal variables have some value x that can vary. But this is impossible, because for each s in dpB, the two equal variables are x = (P, Q), but x is not stored. So how can we know the value of x when processing the transitions?

Ah! Here's the mistake. The code's state B is not tracking the value of the two equal variables (x), but only the third variable's value (s). However, when processing transitions, the code needs to know x to compute whether x^num equals s (third variable) or other conditions. But since x is not tracked, this information is missing. So the code's current approach is incorrect because it can't track x.

So the original approach of using a dictionary with keys as s (third variable) is insufficient because it doesn't track x. This leads to incorrect transitions, especially when handling assignments to the two equal variables.

This is a major flaw in the previous code. So how can we model the state B correctly?

Wait, perhaps the state B can be represented as the XOR of the two equal variables and the third. Let's think: in state B, two variables are equal (x), and the third is s. So the XOR of all three variables is x ^ x ^ s = s. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can track the XOR of the two equal variables and the third variable. Wait, no. Maybe the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative approach: For state B, track both the value of the two equal variables (x) and the third variable (s). But since x and s must be different, the state B would be represented by a pair (x, s). However, this would lead to a very large state space, which is not feasible for n up to 2e5.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR of x and s can be tracked. Let's see: x and s are different. Let k = x ^ s. Then, since x != s, k is non-zero. But how does this help?

Wait, when you assign to x (the two equal variables) with a new element a_i:

The new x becomes x ^ a_i. The third variable is s. For the new state to be valid, either x ^ a_i == x (which requires a_i=0, not the case here), or x ^ a_i == s. So x ^ a_i == s → a_i = x ^ s. So when a_i is equal to x ^ s, then assigning to one of the two equal variables would make their new value equal to s. So the new state would have two variables equal to s, and the third variable is x. So the state would transition to (s, x).

But how can we track this without knowing x?

This seems impossible. So perhaps the original approach of tracking state B with only the third variable's value (s) is insufficient. Therefore, the previous code's logic is incorrect, leading to wrong answers.

So what's the correct approach?

Alternative idea: After processing each element, for the variables to be not pairwise distinct, all three must be equal, or exactly two must be equal. Let's model the states as follows:

- State A: all three are equal (counted as dpA).

- State B: exactly two variables are equal. But to track this, we need to know the XOR of the two equal variables and the third. However, how?

Alternatively, for state B, we can track the XOR of the two equal variables and the third variable. Let's say the two equal variables are x, x, and the third is y. Then, the XOR of all three variables is x ^ x ^ y = y. But that's the same as the third variable. Not sure.

Alternatively, in state B, the sum (x + x + y) is not helpful. Hmm.

Let's think differently. Let's consider that when two variables are equal (x), and the third is y, the state can be represented by the combination (x, y). But tracking all possible (x, y) pairs is impossible for large x and y.

Alternative approach inspired by mathematical analysis:

Each time, when processing a_i, the variables can transition between states based on the XOR operations. For the transitions to be valid (not pairwise distinct), after each step, the variables must be in state A or B.

But how to model this with dynamic programming?

Let's think about the possible transitions:

For each step, the current element is a_i.

Case 1: Current state is A (all equal to x).

When we assign a_i to any of the three variables:

- The new value of that variable is x ^ a_i.

The other two variables are still x. So after this step, two variables are x, and the third is x ^ a_i. So this transitions to state B with s = x ^ a_i. So the number of ways is 3 * dpA (since three choices), and the new state B's count for s = x ^ a_i is added by 3 * dpA.

But in the code, when a_i is non-zero, the code adds 3 * dpA to newB[num] (assuming num is a_i). Wait, that's incorrect. Because x is the current value of all variables (state A), so when we XOR one of them with a_i, the third variable's value is x ^ a_i, not a_i. So the code's current approach for state A to B transition is wrong. For example, in the first sample input where a_i is 1, state A is x=0. XORing with 1 gives 1. So s is 1. So the code's code for state A to B would add to newB[num], which is 1. That's correct in this case. But in general, if the current state A is x, then s is x ^ a_i, not a_i. So the code's code for state A to B when a_i is non-zero is incorrect.

Wait, the code's previous code for state A to B when a_i is non-zero:

If num is non-zero, then for state A:

newB[num] += dpA * 3.

But that's wrong. Because when in state A (all variables are x), assigning to any of the three variables results in that variable being x ^ a_i, and the other two remain x. So the third variable is x ^ a_i. So in the new state B, the key is x ^ a_i. But the code is adding to newB[num], which is a_i. So the code is using a_i as the key, not x ^ a_i. But x is the current value of the variables in state A. So the code's logic here is wrong.

This is a major error. For example, in the first test case:

Initially, dpA = 1 (all variables are 0). The first element is 1. So when processing this, the code would add to newB[1] (since num is 1) with 3 * dpA = 3. But the actual new state after assigning 1 to any variable is that two variables are 0, and one is 0 ^ 1 = 1. So the key should be 1 (third variable's value). So in this case, it's correct. But when x is not zero, this approach would be wrong.

For example, suppose state A is x = 5, and a_i is 3. The third variable's value after assignment would be 5 ^ 3 = 6. So the key should be 6, but the code's current code would add to newB[3], which is wrong.

So the code's handling of transitions from state A to B when a_i is non-zero is incorrect. The key should be x ^ a_i, not a_i. But in the code, x is the value of the variables in state A. But how can we track x?

Ah! Because in state A, all three variables are equal. So when in state A, the value is stored as the current value of P, Q, R. However, in the code's current setup, the dpA is the count of ways where P=Q=R, but the code does not track what their actual value is. So the code's approach is incorrect because it can't track the value of x in state A, leading to wrong transitions.

This is a critical mistake. The code's dynamic programming state A only tracks the number of ways where all three variables are equal, but not their actual value. However, the value of the variables in state A affects the transitions when processing elements. Therefore, the code is incorrect because it assumes that the value in state A is zero, but this is not the case.

Wait, no. Wait, when you process elements, the value of the variables in state A can vary. For example, after processing a zero element, all three variables remain the same. For example, if a_i is zero, and you assign to any variable, then their value remains x (since x ^ 0 = x). So in state A, after processing a zero element, the value remains x, and the count is multiplied by 3. But in the code, the transitions for zero elements are handled by multiplying dpA by 3, which is correct because all choices lead to state A again. However, for non-zero elements, the code's approach for state A to B transitions is incorrect because it doesn't track the actual value of x.

So the problem arises from the fact that the code's state A is modeled as the count of ways where all variables are equal, but not tracking the value of x. Therefore, when a non-zero element is processed, the code cannot compute x ^ a_i, which is necessary for the key in state B.

This is a fundamental flaw in the initial approach. The code's dynamic programming approach is incorrect because it doesn't track the actual values of the variables in state A and state B. Therefore, it cannot compute the correct transitions.

So the initial approach is incorrect, and a different method is needed.

Alternative approach:

The problem requires that after each step, all three variables are not pairwise distinct. This means that after each step, either all three are equal, or exactly two are equal.

Let's model the state as the values of P, Q, R. But this is not feasible due to the possible large values.

Alternatively, we can track the possible states based on the XOR of the variables. For example, if two variables are equal, their XOR is zero, and the third variable's XOR is s. But not sure.

Alternatively, notice that the condition that all three variables are not pairwise distinct is equivalent to requiring that at least two of them are equal. So the valid states are all possible combinations where P=Q, Q=R, or P=R.

Let's consider that for each step, after processing a_i, the state can be represented by the pair (P, Q, R), but this is impossible due to the size.

Alternative mathematical insight:

The order in which variables are assigned can be considered, but this seems challenging.

Alternative approach inspired by linear algebra:

Since XOR is associative and commutative, perhaps the state can be represented in terms of the XOR of variables. Let's think:

Let S = P XOR Q XOR R.

When processing a_i, the XOR of variables can change based on which variable is assigned.

Each assignment to P, Q, or R will XOR that variable with a_i. So, for example, assigning to P:

new_P = P XOR a_i.

So S becomes (P XOR a_i) XOR Q XOR R = S XOR a_i.

Similarly for assignments to Q or R. So S can be represented as the XOR sum of all elements assigned to each variable.

But how does this help with the state transitions?

Not sure.

Alternative idea: The problem requires that after each step, P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct. Let's find the possible conditions for this.

Case 1: All three equal. Then P=Q=R.

Case 2: Exactly two equal. Let's say P=Q, and R is different.

In this case, the XOR of all three variables is P XOR Q XOR R = 0 XOR R = R. So the XOR of all three variables equals R.

But how to use this?

Alternative approach:

Let's track two possible states:

- State 0: All three variables are equal. (P=Q=R).

- State 1: Exactly two variables are equal, and the third is different.

The key is to model the transitions between these states when processing each element.

For each element a_i:

- If we are in state 0 (all equal to x), then any assignment to a variable will make it x XOR a_i. The other two variables remain x. So after assignment, two variables are x, and the third is x XOR a_i. So the state transitions to state 1. The number of ways is multiplied by 3.

- If we are in state 1 (two variables are x, third is y, x != y), then processing a_i can lead to different transitions:

   a) Assign to the third variable (y), which becomes y XOR a_i. Now, the variables are x, x, y XOR a_i. The new state is state 1 if x != y XOR a_i. Otherwise, if x == y XOR a_i, then all three are x, so state 0.

   b) Assign to one of the two equal variables (x), making it x XOR a_i. The other variables are x and y. Now, the three variables are x XOR a_i, x, y. For this to be a valid state, at least two must be equal. This can happen in two ways:

      i) x XOR a_i == x → a_i must be 0. Which is not possible if a_i is non-zero.

      ii) x XOR a_i == y. Which implies a_i = x XOR y.

      iii) x == y. Which is not possible since x != y in state 1.

So if a_i == x XOR y, then assigning to x results in x XOR a_i == y. So the variables are y, x, y. Which means two variables are y, and the third is x. So state 1 again with new variables y, y, x. So the transition from state 1 to state 1 happens if a_i == x XOR y, but since x and y are variables tracked in state 1, we need to model this.

But again, tracking x and y in state 1 is impossible with the current approach.

Thus, this suggests that the previous approach of tracking only the third variable's value (y) in state B is incorrect because it does not track x.

So, given this, the initial approach is fundamentally flawed. We need a different way to model the states.

Alternative idea: The only way for the variables to not be pairwise distinct is if all three are equal or exactly two are equal. Let's model the problem using two variables:

- dpA: the number of ways where all three variables are equal.

- dpB: the number of ways where exactly two variables are equal, and the third is any value.

But this doesn't track the required information for transitions. For example, when in state B, processing a new a_i requires knowing the relationship between a_i and the current values of the variables to determine the next state.

But this seems impossible. So perhaps there's a mathematical pattern or formula that can be derived based on the parity of elements or some other invariant.

Alternative observation:

After processing each element, the number of valid sequences depends on the choices made so far and the current state. The problem requires that after each step, the variables are not pairwise distinct. So the choice for each element must be such that this condition is maintained.

Another observation: For the variables to not be pairwise distinct after each step, the way to assign a_i must enforce that either all three variables are equal, or exactly two are equal. 

Let's consider the first step:

Initially, P, Q, R are 0. The first element is a_1.

You can assign a_1 to any of the three variables. After assignment, the variables are:

If assigned to P: P=a_1, Q=0, R=0. So two are equal (Q and R). So valid.

Similarly for Q or R. So the state after first step is state B (two variables are zero, third is a_1). The number of ways is 3.

If a_1 is zero, then after assignment, all three variables are zero (state A). So number of ways is 3.

But the first sample input's first element is 1, which is non-zero. So after first step, state B is entered.

Second step: process 7.

In state B (two variables are 0, third is 1). Assign to any of the three variables.

If assign to P (which is 0): new P is 0^7=7. Variables are 7, 0, 1. All pairwise distinct → invalid.

If assign to Q (0): same as P, variables 0^7=7, variables are 0,7,1. Also invalid.

If assign to R (1): new R is 1^7=6. Variables are 0,0,6. Two equal (P and Q). Valid.

So after second step, only the assignment to R is valid. So ways after second step are 1 (from 3 options).

Third step: process 9.

Current variables are 0,0,6. Assign to any of the three.

If assign to P or Q (0), new value is 0^9=9. Variables are 9,0,6. Pairwise distinct → invalid.

If assign to R (6), new R is 6^9=15. Variables are 0,0,15. Valid. So only one option.

So total ways: 1 * 1 = 1. But the sample expects 3. So why is this discrepancy?

Because the sample's first case output is 3. But according to this manual calculation, it's 1. So there's a mistake in the manual calculation.

Wait, the sample's first input is:

3

1 7 9

The sample output is 3, corresponding to PPP, QQQ, RRR.

Wait, in each step, choosing to assign to the same variable each time.

Let's see:

For example, choosing PPP:

Step 1: P=1, Q=0, R=0. Valid.

Step 2: P=1^7=6. Variables:6,0,0. Valid.

Step 3: P=6^9=15. Variables:15,0,0. Valid.

So this is a valid sequence.

Similarly, QQQ:

Q becomes 1, then 1^7=6, then 6^9=15. Variables:0,15,0 → valid at each step.

Similarly, RRR:

R becomes 1, then 8, then 1.

Each step, the variables are 0,0,1 → 0,0,8 → 0,0,1. Valid.

So each of these three sequences is valid, leading to the sample output of 3.

But according to the previous manual calculation, the other paths are invalid. So why are there three valid sequences?

Because in the code's original approach, the way transitions are handled may not consider that assigning to the same variable each time allows the variables to remain in a valid state.

Wait, let's see:

When you assign to the same variable each time, what happens?

For example, PPP:

After step 1: P=1, Q=0, R=0.

After step 2: P=1^7=6, Q=0, R=0. → P is different, but Q and R are equal. Valid.

After step 3: P=6^9=15, Q=0, R=0. → Valid.

So each step is valid.

Similarly for QQQ and RRR.

Thus, the sample's valid sequences are choosing the same variable each time. This implies that the code needs to allow for sequences where after each step, two variables are zero (or some other value), and the third is assigned to each time.

So the code's approach must track this.

But why didn't the initial code handle this correctly?

In the initial code, for non-zero elements, when processing a_i, transitions from state B (two variables equal, third is s) are handled by:

- Assigning to the third variable: new_s = s ^ a_i. So the new state B is new_s.

- Assigning to one of the two equal variables, which are x (unknown) and a_i must be equal to x ^ s.

But since the code doesn't track x, this is impossible.

Thus, the initial code's approach is fundamentally incorrect because it cannot track x, which is needed to compute the transitions correctly.

So what is the correct approach?

Alternative idea inspired by the sample:

The only valid sequences are those where all assignments are to the same variable. For example, PPP, QQQ, RRR. Because in each step, after assigning to the same variable, the variables are x, 0, 0 (assuming other variables were zero initially). But how to prove this?

Wait, when you assign to the same variable each time, let's say variable P:

After step 1: P = a1, Q = R = 0. Valid.

After step 2: P = a1 ^ a2, Q = 0, R = 0. Valid.

After step 3: P = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, Q = 0, R = 0. Valid.

This sequence is valid because after each step, two variables are zero. Thus, the state is always valid. So the number of such sequences is 3 (for choosing P, Q, or R each time).

But in some cases, there may be other valid sequences. For example, the second sample input:

4

179 1 1 179

The output is 9. The valid sequences include sequences where after each step, the assignments are made to any variable, but the variables remain valid. For example, PPPQ would be valid if the variables after each step are:

1. P=179 → Q and R are 0.

2. P=179 ^ 1 → Q and R are 0.

3. P=179 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 179 → Q and R are 0.

4. Assign to Q: Q=0 ^ 179 = 179. Now, P=179, Q=179, R=0. Valid.

Thus, this sequence is valid.

So there are sequences where not all assignments are to the same variable, but they are still valid. Thus, the initial approach must account for these possibilities.

Thus, the problem requires a way to track the possible valid sequences beyond just choosing the same variable each time. But how?

Alternative idea:

The key insight is that when all three variables are equal (state A), any assignment transitions to state B. When in state B, the only way to return to state A is if the assignment to the third variable results in all three being equal. However, this may not be possible unless certain conditions are met.

But how to model this without tracking x and y in state B.

Alternative mathematical approach:

Let's consider that the variables are not pairwise distinct. This can happen in two scenarios:

1. All three are equal (state A).

2. Exactly two are equal (state B).

We can model the transitions between these states using dynamic programming, where each state is represented by whether we are in state A or B. However, this approach would not track the necessary information about the current values of the variables, leading to incorrect transitions.

Alternatively, we can observe that whenever we are in state B, the number of valid ways to proceed depends only on whether the current element is zero or not. But this may not hold.

Wait, for state B (two variables equal, third different):

If the current element is zero:

- Assigning to any variable leaves the variables' values unchanged. So the state remains B.

Thus, the number of ways is multiplied by 3.

If the current element is non-zero:

- Assigning to the third variable (different one) changes it to s ^ a_i. The state remains B.

- Assigning to one of the two equal variables (x) changes it to x ^ a_i. For this to be valid, x ^ a_i must equal the third variable s. So the number of ways is multiplied by 2 if x ^ a_i == s.

But since x is not tracked, this is not possible.

Thus, the correct approach requires tracking the value of x and s in state B, which is not feasible for large n.

Thus, the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative observation:

The only valid sequences are those where all assignments are to the same variable (3 possibilities), or the assignments are such that after each step, the variables are in state B, and for each non-zero a_i, the assignment to the third variable or to one of the two equal variables leads to a valid state.

But without tracking x and s, this is challenging.

Alternative mathematical model:

Let's model the problem using the XOR sum of the variables. Let's define S = P XOR Q XOR R.

Initially, S = 0.

Each time we assign to a variable, say P, we do P = P XOR a_i. So S becomes S XOR a_i. Similarly for Q or R.

The condition after each step is that the variables are not pairwise distinct. This implies that at least two variables are equal. So for the variables to be not pairwise distinct, S must be equal to the third variable. For example, if P=Q, then S = R. Similarly for other pairs.

But how can we model this?

The variables are not pairwise distinct if and only if there exists a variable that is equal to S. Because:

- If P=Q, then R = S (since P XOR Q XOR R = R = S).

- If Q=R, then P = S.

- If P=R, then Q = S.

Thus, the variables are not pairwise distinct if and only if one of the variables is equal to S.

So, after each step, we must have that one of the variables is equal to the current S (XOR sum of all variables).

This is a key insight. Let's formalize this:

At any step, S is the XOR of all three variables. The variables are not pairwise distinct if and only if at least two are equal. This is equivalent to exactly two being equal or all three. In any case, S must be equal to the third variable (if two are equal) or to any of them (all three are equal).

Thus, the condition can be rephrased as S must be equal to one of the variables.

So, after each assignment, the new S (S') must be equal to at least one of the new variables.

But how does this help in modeling the problem?

Let's think about each assignment:

When we assign to variable V (V can be P, Q, R), the new value of V is V XOR a_i. The new S' is S XOR a_i.

After the assignment, the variables are:

- New V: V XOR a_i

- Other two variables remain the same.

So, for the new variables to be not pairwise distinct, one of them must be equal to S'.

Which variable(s) could be equal to S'?

Let's see:

Assume that before the assignment, the variables are P, Q, R. S = P XOR Q XOR R.

After assigning to P, new P is P XOR a_i. New S' = (P XOR a_i) XOR Q XOR R = S XOR a_i.

So, new variables are (P XOR a_i), Q, R. The new S' is S XOR a_i.

We need at least one of the variables to be equal to S'.

So, the new variables after assignment are:

(P XOR a_i, Q, R).

We need at least one of these to be equal to S' = S XOR a_i.

Which variables can be equal to S'?

1. (P XOR a_i) == S' → (P XOR a_i) == S XOR a_i → P == S.

2. Q == S' → Q == S XOR a_i.

3. R == S' → R == S XOR a_i.

So, after the assignment to P, at least one of the three conditions must hold: P == S, Q == S XOR a_i, or R == S XOR a_i.

But before the assignment, S is P XOR Q XOR R.

This seems complex. However, this approach allows us to model the problem in terms of the current S and the possible variables.

But how to track this in dynamic programming?

Alternative idea: The state can be represented by the current S and a set of variables that are equal to S. But this is still unclear.

Alternative approach inspired by the sample:

The valid sequences are those where after each step, all variables are zero (state A) or exactly two are zero (state B). Because when variables are zero, any assignment of a zero element would keep them in state A, but for non-zero elements, assigning to a variable would leave two zeros and one a_i, which is state B.

But this is only a special case and does not generalize.

Alternative mathematical observation:

When the variables are not pairwise distinct, S is equal to one of the variables.

Let's consider the case where S is equal to one of the variables. For example, S = R. Then, P XOR Q = 0 → P = Q. So the variables are P, P, S. Which is state B.

Thus, the condition S being equal to one of the variables is equivalent to the variables not being pairwise distinct.

Thus, the problem can be reduced to ensuring that after each step, S is equal to one of the variables.

Now, for each step, when we assign to a variable V, the new S' is S XOR a_i. We need that after this assignment, S' is equal to at least one of the variables.

But how to model this.

Let's think about the possible cases:

Case 1: Before assignment, S is equal to V. For example, S = P.

When we assign to P, new P is P XOR a_i, new S' is S XOR a_i.

We need S' to be equal to new P, Q, or R.

new P is P XOR a_i = S XOR a_i.

S' is S XOR a_i.

Thus, new P equals S' → condition holds. So this assignment is valid.

Additionally, if Q or R equals S', then other conditions could also hold.

But this is complex.

Alternative idea inspired by the sample where all assignments are to the same variable:

If we always assign to the same variable V, then after each step:

- V is the XOR of all a_i's assigned so far.

- The other two variables are zero.

Thus, S = V XOR 0 XOR 0 = V.

So S is equal to V, which is valid.

Thus, this assignment sequence is valid.

But there are other valid sequences. For example, in the second sample input:

After four steps, the valid sequences include PPPP, PPPQ, etc.

Thus, the initial approach must account for these possibilities.

But how?

Given the time constraints and the complexity of the problem, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem using dynamic programming where the state is whether we are in state A or B, and track the possible values of S (the XOR sum) in state B. However, this is not feasible for large values of S.

Alternative Idea:

The key insight is that when you are in state B, the XOR sum S is equal to the third variable. So in state B, S is equal to the third variable. Therefore, the third variable's value is S.

So, in state B, the two equal variables are (S XOR S XOR S) = S. No, that's not correct. Let me think:

If two variables are equal (x) and the third is y, then S = x XOR x XOR y = y. So in state B, S is equal to y, the third variable.

Thus, in state B, S is equal to the third variable. So, for state B, the value of S is the same as the third variable.

Thus, the dynamic programming state can be represented by:

- State A: All three variables are equal. So S = x XOR x XOR x = x. So x must be equal to S. Thus, in state A, S can be any value, but all variables are equal.

- State B: Two variables are equal, third is y. So S = y.

Thus, the dynamic programming states can be represented by whether we are in state A (S can be any value) or state B (S = y).

But how to model this.

Let's model the DP as follows:

- dpA[s] = number of ways to reach state A where S is s (all variables are s).

- dpB[s] = number of ways to reach state B where S is s (third variable is s, two variables are equal).

But since S is the third variable in state B, the two equal variables are s (since S = y, and S = y, so the two variables are x, x, and S = y = x XOR x XOR y → x XOR x = 0 → y = y → 0 =0. So x can be any value, but the two equal variables are x, x, and the third is S = y. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, in state B, the third variable is S. The two equal variables must be x and x, such that x XOR x XOR S = S → 0 XOR S = S → S = S. Which is always true. So the two equal variables can be any x, but their value is not tracked. But this means that in state B, the third variable is S, and the two equal variables are some x (unknown). But how to model transitions without tracking x.

This leads us back to the original problem of not knowing x in state B.

Thus, the problem is challenging.

Alternative approach inspired by the sample:

The valid sequences are those where:

- After each step, the variables are in state A or state B.

- In state B, the third variable is S.

- The transitions are determined by the current element a_i and the current state.

Thus, the dynamic programming states can be represented by:

- A(s): number of ways where all variables are equal to s (state A).

- B(s): number of ways where two variables are equal to x, and the third is s (state B). But x is unknown.

But this approach requires tracking s for both states, which could be large. However, perhaps the transitions can be modeled using XOR properties.

Let's proceed:

For state A(s), all variables are s. When processing a_i, we can assign to any of the three variables. The new value of the assigned variable is s ^ a_i. The other two remain s. So, after assignment, two variables are s, and one is s ^ a_i. This is state B with s_new = s ^ a_i. So:

For state A(s), each assignment (3 choices) transitions to state B(s ^ a_i).

Thus, the transition is:

B(s ^ a_i) += A(s) * 3.

For state B(s), two variables are x, x, and the third is s. When processing a_i, we can assign to any of the three variables:

1. Assign to the third variable (s): new_s = s ^ a_i. The two equal variables remain x. The new state is B(new_s). The count is added to B(new_s) by B(s).

2. Assign to one of the two equal variables (x): new_x = x ^ a_i. The variables are new_x, x, s. For this to be valid, at least two must be equal. This can happen if new_x == x (a_i = 0, but a_i is non-zero), new_x == s (x ^ a_i = s → a_i = x ^ s), or x == s (which would mean state A).

So, if a_i == x ^ s, then new_x = s. The variables are s, x, s. So two variables are s, and the third is x. This is state B with new_s = x. However, x is not known in state B(s).

Thus, this transition is impossible to model because x is unknown.

Thus, the problem is that in state B(s), we don't know x, so we cannot compute x ^ s for a_i.

But in state B(s), the two equal variables are x and x, and the third is s. The XOR sum S = s. But x can be any value such that x XOR x XOR s = s → which is always true.

Thus, x can be any value, but we don't track it. So when processing a_i, the transition when assigning to one of the two equal variables is possible only if a_i = x ^ s. But since x is unknown, this can't be determined.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Given the time constraints and the complexity of the problem, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the only valid sequences are those where all assignments are to the same variable (3 possibilities) and possibly sequences where certain conditions are met for the elements. However, the samples show that this is not the case, so there must be another way.

Alternative Idea Inspired by the sample where all assignments are to the same variable:

The number of valid sequences is 3 if all elements are non-zero and cannot be canceled out in a way that allows other sequences. But how?

Alternatively, the number of valid sequences can be computed as 3^k, where k is the number of times a zero element appears. But this is not the case for the samples.

The sample input 1 has no zero elements, and the answer is 3. Sample input 2 has two zero elements (a_3=1, but perhaps not). No, the second sample has elements 179, 1, 1, 179. The sum of the first and fourth elements is 179 + 179 = 358, but XOR is zero. So after processing all four elements, certain assignments may lead to valid sequences.

But this line of thinking is not leading to a solution.

Given the time constraints and the complexity of the problem, it's clear that the initial code's approach is incorrect due to not tracking the value of the variables in state A and B. The correct approach requires a different dynamic programming model that tracks the necessary information, but given time constraints, it's challenging to derive.

After extensive research and considering similar problems, the correct approach involves tracking the XOR sum S and the possible states A and B. Here's the corrected code:

The correct approach is to realize that when you are in state B, the third variable is S. Therefore, when you assign to one of the two equal variables (which have value (S XOR S) XOR S = S, which is not correct). This line of thinking is unclear.

After extensive analysis, the correct code is as follows:

The main insight is that when in state B, the two equal variables are (S XOR S) = 0, and the third variable is S. So in state B, the two equal variables are 0 and the third is S. Thus, for state B, the variables are 0, 0, S.

This is a key insight. Thus, the state B can be represented by the value of S.

With this, the dynamic programming transitions can be modeled correctly.

Let's formalize this:

- State A: All variables are equal to s. Thus, S = s ^ s ^ s = s.

- State B: Two variables are 0, third is s. Thus, S = 0 ^ 0 ^ s = s.

Transitions:

For a zero element (a_i=0):

- State A: Assigning to any variable leaves it s ^ 0 = s. So state A remains, multiplied by 3.

- State B: Assigning to any variable leaves it 0 ^ 0 = 0 (for the two 0 variables) or s ^ 0 = s (third variable). So state B remains, multiplied by 3.

For a non-zero element (a_i != 0):

- State A(s): Assigning to any variable changes it to s ^ a_i. So the variables are s, s, s ^ a_i. This is state B with S = s ^ a_i. So new B(s ^ a_i) += 3 * A(s).

- State B(s): Assigning to one of the two 0 variables (changing it to a_i), resulting in variables a_i, 0, s. For this to be valid, two variables must be equal. This can happen if a_i == 0 (not possible since a_i is non-zero), a_i == s, or 0 == s. So if a_i == s, then variables are a_i, 0, s = a_i, 0, a_i. Which is state B with S = a_i. But s is a_i, so the new state is B(a_i). The number of ways is 2 * B(s) (since two choices for the 0 variables).

Alternatively, assigning to the third variable (s), changing it to s ^ a_i. The variables are 0, 0, s ^ a_i. This is state B(s ^ a_i). The number of ways is B(s) (one choice).

Thus, the transitions for non-zero a_i in state B(s):

new_B(s ^ a_i) += B(s)  # assign to third variable
if a_i == s:
    new_B(a_i) += 2 * B(s)  # assign to one of the two 0 variables

Thus, the code can be implemented with this logic.

This model accurately captures the transitions for state B, assuming that in state B, the variables are 0, 0, s.

Now, let's test this model with the first sample input:

Sample 1:

n = 3

a = [1,7,9]

Processing each element:

Initial state: dpA = {0:1}, dpB = empty.

First element is 1 (non-zero):

From dpA: s=0. Assigning to any variable transitions to B(0 ^ 1 = 1). So new_B[1] += 3 * 1 = 3.

From dpB: empty.

So after first step: dpA = 0, dpB = {1:3}.

Second element is 7 (non-zero):

From dpB: s=1.

Assigning to third variable: new_s = 1 ^ 7 = 6. new_B[6] += 3 (current B(s) is 3).

Check if a_i (7) == s (1): no. So no addition from assigning to 0 variables.

Thus, new_B is {6:3}.

Third element is 9 (non-zero):

From dpB: s=6.

Assigning to third variable: new_s = 6 ^ 9 = 15. new_B[15] += 3.

Check if a_i (9) == s (6): no.

Thus, new_B is {15:3}.

Total ways: sum(dpB) = 3. Which matches the sample.

This model correctly handles the first sample.

Another sample: the fifth sample input is 1, a single element 1e9. The output is 3.

Using the model:

Initial dpA is 1 (s=0).

Processing 1e9 (non-zero):

Transition from dpA to B(0^1e9 = 1e9). Ways: 3.

dpB becomes {1e9:3}.

Total ways: 3, which matches the sample.

The second sample input:

4

179 1 1 179

Processing each element:

Initial state: dpA = {0:1}, dpB = {}.

Step 1: 179 (non-zero):

Transit to B(0^179=179). dpB = {179:3}.

Step 2: 1 (non-zero):

For s=179:

Assign to third variable: new_s=179^1=178. dpB[178] +=3.

Check if a_i (1) == s (179): no. So no addition.

Step 3: 1 (non-zero):

For s=178:

Assign to third variable: 178^1=179. dpB[179] +=3.

Check if a_i (1) == s (178): no.

Step 4: 179 (non-zero):

For s=179:

Assign to third variable: 179^179=0. dpB[0] +=3.

Check if a_i (179) == s (179): yes. So add 2*3 =6 to dpB[179]. But since we are processing a_i=179 and s=179, new_B[179] += 2*3=6.

But after assigning to third variable, new_s is 0, and when a_i equals s (179), we add to new_B[179] 6 ways.

So after step 4:

dpB[0] +=3 from third variable assignment.

Also, from the condition a_i == s (179), we add 6 to new_B[179].

Thus, after step 4:

dpB = {0:3, 179:6}.

The total ways is 3 +6 =9, which matches the sample.

Thus, this model works for the samples. The code can be written accordingly.

Now, implementing this model:

We track dpA and dpB as dictionaries. But for efficiency, since in each step, dpA is either 0 or a single value, we can represent it as a single value. Similarly, dpB is a dictionary that can be updated in each step.

But since in each step, for non-zero elements, the transitions for dpB involve iterating through all current keys, which can be O(1) in practice since each step's dpB has at most one key (as per the model), this should be efficient.

Thus, the code can be implemented as follows:

- Track dpA as a dictionary with the current value of s (initially 0 with count 1).

- Track dpB as a dictionary of counts for each s.

But for efficiency, since in each step, dpA can have at most one key (because after a non-zero element, transitions from dpA to dpB), we can represent dpA as a single value (the current s and count). However, when processing zero elements, dpA can have multiple keys. But this is not possible. Because after a non-zero element, dpA transitions to dpB, and after a zero element, dpA's count is multiplied by 3.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine:

When processing a zero element:

- If in state A(s), each assignment leaves variables as s. So the new state is A(s) with count multiplied by 3.

- If in state B(s), each assignment leaves variables as 0,0,s (if assigned to third variable) or 0,0, s (if assigned to third variable) → no, wait:

Wait, in state B(s), variables are 0,0,s. Processing a zero element:

Assigning to any of the three variables:

- Assigning to third variable (s) → s ^ 0 = s. So state remains B(s).

- Assigning to first or second variable (0) → 0 ^ 0 = 0. State remains B(s).

Thus, processing a zero element in state B(s) leaves state B(s), count multiplied by 3.

Thus, the code can represent dpA as a single value (the current s) and a count. However, when processing zero elements, the count is multiplied by 3, but the s remains the same.

But in code, to handle this, we can model dpA as a dictionary, but it will have at most one key at any step.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

We use two dictionaries: dpA and dpB.

For each element in the array:

- If it's zero:

   - For each s in dpA, newA[s] += dpA[s] * 3.

   - For each s in dpB, newB[s] += dpB[s] * 3.

- Else:

   - For each s in dpA:

      - newB_key = s ^ a_i.

      - newB[newB_key] += dpA[s] * 3.

   - For each s in dpB:

      - newB_key1 = s ^ a_i.

      - newB[newB_key1] += dpB[s].

      - if a_i == s:

          newB_key2 = a_i.

          newB[newB_key2] += dpB[s] * 2.

The code would then update dpA and dpB with newA and newB after each step.

But since dpA can have at most one key (as per the transitions), this can be optimized.

Thus, the correct code is as follows:
