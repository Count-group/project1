To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of coins required to reconnect a tree after removing a vertex and all its incident edges. The cost of reconnecting the tree is based on the weights of the vertices used to form new edges, which increase each time a vertex is used.

### Approach
1. **Tree Structure and Vertex Removal**: For each vertex `u`, removing it splits the tree into several components equal to the degree of `u`. Each component is a subtree rooted at one of `u`'s neighbors.
2. **Component Analysis**: After removing `u`, the tree splits into `k` components, where `k` is the degree of `u`. To reconnect these components, we need `k-1` edges.
3. **Optimal Edge Selection**: The goal is to select edges such that the total cost is minimized. The optimal approach involves selecting the smallest weights from the remaining nodes while ensuring each component contributes at most `k-1` nodes.

### Solution Code
```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    w = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for _ in range(n-1):
        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        edges[u].append(v)
        edges[v].append(u)
    
    # Compute degrees
    degree = [0]*(n+1)
    for u in range(1, n+1):
        degree[u] = len(edges[u])
    
    # Sort all nodes by their weight, keeping track of their original indices
    nodes = sorted([(w[i], i+1) for i in range(n)], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    # Precompute for each node, the positions in the sorted list
    sorted_w_excluding = []
    for u in range(1, n+1):
        res = []
        for val, idx in nodes:
            if idx != u:
                res.append(val)
        sorted_w_excluding.append(res)
    
    # For each node u, compute the answer
    for u in range(1, n+1):
        k = degree[u]
        if k <= 1:
            print(0, end=' ')
        else:
            m = 2 * (k - 1)
            arr = sorted_w_excluding[u-1]
            if m > len(arr):
                # This should not happen as m <= 2*(n-1) and len(arr) is n-1 (exclude u)
                print(0, end=' ')
            else:
                total = sum(arr[:m])
                print(total, end=' ')
    print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Tree Structure and Degrees**: The code first reads the input and constructs the tree. It calculates the degree of each vertex, which determines the number of components formed when that vertex is removed.
2. **Sorting Nodes**: All nodes are sorted by their weights to facilitate selecting the smallest weights efficiently.
3. **Precompute Excluded Weights**: For each vertex `u`, a list of weights excluding `u` is created and sorted. This helps in quickly determining the smallest weights needed to reconnect the tree.
4. **Calculate Minimum Cost**: For each vertex `u`, based on its degree, the minimum cost is computed by summing the smallest `2*(k-1)` weights from the sorted list of remaining nodes, where `k` is the degree of `u`.

This approach ensures that the solution efficiently computes the minimum cost for each vertex by leveraging sorting and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.
