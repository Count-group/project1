Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine the structure of a full binary tree with n levels by querying the LCA of pairs of nodes. The goal is to find the parent of each node, with the root having -1. The constraints are that n can be up to 10, which means the tree has up to 1023 nodes. But I can only use 4800 queries. Hmm, how to approach this?

First, I remember that a full binary tree with n levels has exactly 2^n -1 nodes. The root is level 1, and each subsequent level doubles the number of nodes. So for n=2, the root has two children, etc.

The key here is to find the parent of each node. Since each node except the root has exactly one parent, the challenge is to determine the hierarchy efficiently.

The LCA of two nodes u and v is their deepest common ancestor. For example, if u is in the left subtree and v is in the right subtree of the root, then their LCA is the root. If one is the ancestor of the other, then the LCA is the ancestor.

So how can I use LCA queries to find the structure of the tree?

I recall that in a full binary tree, the left and right children of a node can be determined based on their positions. But since the IDs are arbitrary, the positions (like left or right) aren't known. So we need a way to map the given IDs to their positions in the tree structure.

Wait, the tree is a full binary tree, so the structure is fixed. The problem is that the IDs are permuted, but the tree's actual hierarchy is the same as a perfect binary tree. So the nodes are arranged in a complete binary tree structure, but each node has a unique ID in a permutation of 1..2^n-1.

So the problem is equivalent to figuring out for each node, which nodes are its children and parent in this structure.

An approach might be to find the root first. Because the root is the LCA of any two nodes that are in different subtrees. For example, if we take two leaves in different subtrees, their LCA is the root.

Alternatively, the root is the LCA of any two nodes that are in the left and right subtrees of the root. But how do I find which nodes those are?

Alternatively, the root is the only node that is the ancestor of all other nodes. But since the tree is a full binary tree, the root is the common ancestor of all pairs except those pairs where one is an ancestor of the other.

But how to find the root efficiently?

Another idea: For each node, the number of times it is returned as the LCA in queries can indicate its position. The root would be the LCA of many pairs, especially those from different subtrees. But this could be time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe using a BFS-like approach. Start by finding the root, then find its two children, then their children, and so on.

But how to find the root?

Let's think: For a full binary tree, the root is the LCA of any two nodes from the left and right subtrees. So if I can find two nodes whose LCA is the root, then the root is their LCA. But how to find such pairs?

Alternatively, for any node u, if I query u and v for several different v's, the node that appears the most as LCA could be the root. But that's not necessarily reliable.

Alternatively, here's a method:

In a full binary tree, the root is the only node that has no parent. So once the parent array is built, the root is the one with f_i = -1. But the problem is to find that array.

But how to build that array with queries.

Wait, for any node u, its parent is the LCA of u and some other node. For example, if u is a leaf, then the parent of u is the LCA of u and any node in the other subtree of the parent.

Alternatively, think about siblings. Two siblings have their parent as their LCA. So if two nodes have their LCA equal to their parent, then they are siblings.

But how to find that.

Alternatively, here's a plan:

1. Find the root. The root is the LCA of any two nodes in the left and right subtrees. So perhaps, by querying pairs of nodes until we get a common ancestor, and then that node is a candidate. But this could be time-consuming.

Alternatively, for a full binary tree, the root's ID is the LCA of all pairs of nodes that are in the left and right subtrees. So if we can find two nodes whose LCA is the root, then that gives us the root.

But how?

Another approach: For a given node u, find the LCA of u and all other nodes. The maximum depth LCA would be the root. Wait, no. Because the LCA of u with itself is u, but for any other node v, the LCA could be higher up.

Alternatively, the root is the LCA of two nodes that are in the left and right subtrees. So perhaps for a pair (u, v) where u is in left subtree and v is in right, their LCA is root. But how to find such pairs?

Alternatively, here's a method to find the root:

For any two nodes u and v, their LCA is the root if and only if u is in the left subtree and v is in the right subtree of the root. So if we can find such a pair, we get the root. But how to find such pairs?

But since the structure is unknown, how to find such pairs?

Alternative idea: For each node, the root is the ancestor of all nodes. So the root's ID will be the LCA of any two nodes that are in different subtrees of the root. But again, how to find such nodes.

Alternatively, the root is the only node that is the LCA of a pair of nodes from its left and right subtrees. All other LCAs would be deeper in the tree.

But how to find this.

Alternatively, here's a possible strategy:

Start with all possible nodes. For each node, check if it's the root by verifying that it's the LCA of two nodes that are in different subtrees. But since the tree is large for n=10, this would take O(2^20) queries, which is way too much.

This seems impractical.

Alternative approach inspired by the sample input:

In the sample, the root is 3. Any query between two different nodes (like 1 and 2) gives root 3. So maybe the root is the LCA of any two nodes that are its children.

So if I can find two nodes whose LCA is some node x, and then for x, if x's children have their LCA as x, then x is a possible parent.

Wait, but in the sample, the root's children (1 and 2) have their LCA as the root.

But siblings (like 1 and 2) have their LCA as their parent (the root). Wait, no. Siblings' LCA is their parent. So in the sample, 1 and 2 are siblings, their LCA is their parent (3). So the root is their parent.

So maybe the idea is to find siblings first, then build the hierarchy.

So here's a possible approach:

- Start by finding all pairs of nodes whose LCA is a third node. If two nodes u and v have LCA x, then x is their common ancestor. If x is their parent, then u and v are siblings.

So the plan could be:

1. Find the root. Once the root is found, split the remaining nodes into left and right subtrees.

2. For each subtree, recursively find the root of that subtree (which is the child of the current root), and repeat.

But how to split into left and right subtrees once the root is known.

Alternatively, here's a step-by-step approach:

The root is the LCA of any two nodes that are in different subtrees. So to find the root, perhaps query a pair of nodes. Let's say their LCA is x. Then x is the LCA. If x is the root, then the two nodes are in different subtrees. But if x is not the root, then the two nodes are in the same subtree of x.

But how to find the root?

Alternatively, here's a method inspired by BFS:

The root is the LCA of any two nodes. Suppose I have a list of candidate nodes. For each pair among them, query their LCA. The LCA that is highest in the hierarchy (i.e., the one that is the root) would be the answer. But how to find that.

Alternatively, for a set of nodes, their LCA is the root if they are spread across left and right subtrees.

But perhaps an efficient way is to use a divide and conquer approach.

Let's think recursively. For a given subtree of height h, the root of that subtree is determined. Then its left and right children can be found by partitioning the nodes in that subtree into two groups, each for left and right.

But how?

Another idea is to represent each node by the path from the root. For example, in a binary tree, each node can be represented by a binary string indicating left (0) and right (1) moves from the root. But the problem is that the root is unknown.

But once the root is known, the rest can be determined by querying pairs of nodes and seeing their LCA. For example, if the root is r, then for any two nodes u and v in the left subtree of r, their LCA is the root of their subtree. So recursively, we can find the structure.

Wait, this seems like a possible approach. Let's outline it:

1. Find the root r.

2. For all nodes except r, partition them into the left and right subtrees of r.

3. Recursively process each subtree, finding their root (the left and right children of r), and so on.

The key steps are:

- How to find the root.

- How to partition the nodes into left and right subtrees once the root is known.

So for step 1, finding the root:

The root is the LCA of any two nodes from different subtrees. But how to find such a pair.

Suppose we pick two arbitrary nodes u and v. Let their LCA be x. If x is not r, then both u and v are in the same subtree of x. So then, perhaps we can pick another node w, and query LCA(u, w). If the result is x again, then w is also in the same subtree. But if the result is higher (like r), then perhaps w is in the other subtree.

But this is not guaranteed. However, if we collect all possible nodes and keep finding their LCAs, the highest possible LCA (the root) will eventually emerge.

Alternatively, pick a few nodes and query their pairwise LCAs. The node that appears most frequently as an LCA is likely to be the root, but this is not certain.

Alternatively, here's a method: the root is the LCA of the maximum number of pairs. For example, in a tree of height n, the root is the LCA of all pairs where one node is in the left subtree and the other in the right. The number of such pairs is (2^{n-1}-1) * (2^{n-1}-1) * 2 (since each subtree has 2^{n-1} -1 nodes). That's a lot. So the root would be the LCA of the most pairs.

So if I can find the node that is the LCA of the most pairs of nodes, that would be the root.

But how to find that without querying all possible pairs.

Alternatively, select a subset of nodes and query their pairwise LCAs, then the node that appears the most is the root candidate.

But even this could take a lot of queries.

Alternatively, for a small subset of nodes (like 10), query all pairs. The LCA of the majority would be the root. Since the root is the LCA of any two nodes from different subtrees. So if the subset contains nodes from both subtrees, their LCAs would be the root. But if the subset is all from one subtree, then their LCA would be some ancestor in that subtree.

So perhaps, by randomly selecting a few nodes and querying their LCAs, the root would emerge as the highest LCA among them.

But this approach's efficiency depends on how the nodes are chosen.

Alternatively, here's a deterministic approach:

Take two nodes u and v. Let their LCA be x. Then x is their common ancestor. If x is the root, then u and v are in different subtrees. Otherwise, they are in the same subtree of x. Then, take another node w, and find LCA(u, w). Let this be y. If y is higher than x (closer to root), then w is in the other subtree. So the root would be the LCA of x and y.

But how to determine "higher" when we don't know the tree structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the LCA of u and v is x, and the LCA of x and some other node is y. If y is x's parent, then x's parent is higher.

But again, how to determine this.

Alternatively, here's an algorithm inspired by finding the root:

- Select three nodes: a, b, c.

- Find the LCA of a and b: x.

- Find the LCA of x and c: y.

- If y is x, then x is the ancestor of c, so c is in the subtree of x.

- If y is not x, then x and c are in different subtrees of y, making y their LCA, which is higher.

But perhaps this can be used to find the root.

But this seems a bit vague.

Alternatively, here's a method:

The root is the node that is the LCA of the maximum possible number of pairs. So, if we select a few nodes and compute their LCAs, the root is likely to be the one that is the result of the most queries.

But again, how to implement this.

Alternatively, here's a different approach. Since the tree is a full binary tree, each node has exactly 0 or 2 children. So, once we know the parent of a node, we can determine where it is in the tree.

But how to find the parent.

Another idea: For any node u, its parent is the LCA of u and any node in the other subtree of the parent.

Wait, for example, if u is in the left child of p, then any node in the right subtree of p would have their LCA with u as p. So, if we can find a node v such that LCA(u, v) is p, then p is the parent of u.

But how to find such a v.

Alternatively, here's a plan:

1. For each node u, find all nodes v where LCA(u, v) is some x. The x with the smallest possible depth (i.e., the highest in the tree) is the parent of u.

But how to compute that.

Alternatively, for each node u, query it with all other nodes, and collect all possible LCAs. The parent of u is the LCA that is the immediate ancestor. But again, this would take O(N) queries per node, which is way too much for n=10 (N=1023).

So for n=10, 1023 nodes, this would take 1023 * 1023 = over a million queries, which is way more than 4800.

So this approach is not feasible.

We need a smarter way.

Alternative approach inspired by the structure of a full binary tree. Let's think of the tree in terms of levels. The root is level 1, its children level 2, etc. Each node in level i has two children in level i+1.

So the problem is to assign each node to a level and determine the parent.

But how to find the level of a node.

The LCA of two leaves would be the deepest common ancestor. But without knowing the leaves, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the root can be found by finding a node that is the LCA of two nodes that are leaves. But again, how to find leaves.

Hmm.

Alternative idea: The leaves are the nodes that are never returned as the LCA of any pair (except when the pair includes themselves). So if a node is not an LCA of any pair except itself, then it's a leaf. But how to verify that.

But to check if a node is a leaf, you have to see if there's any pair (u, v) where their LCA is that node, other than pairs involving the node itself or its siblings.

Alternatively, this is getting complicated.

Perhaps another way to approach this is to realize that the parent of a node u can be found by finding a node p such that p is the LCA of u and some other node not in u's subtree.

But how to find that.

Alternatively, for a given node u, find the set of all nodes v where LCA(u, v) is p. Then p is the parent of u if for all such v, their LCA with u is p and p is the same for all of them.

But this requires querying multiple nodes v for each u, which could be expensive.

Another observation: In a full binary tree, the parent of a node u is the LCA of u and any node in the other subtree of the parent. For example, if u is in the left subtree of p, then any node v in the right subtree of p will have LCA(u, v) = p.

So, if we can find two nodes u and v such that their LCA is p, and u and v are in different subtrees of p, then p is their parent.

But how to find such pairs.

Alternatively, the idea is to find pairs of nodes that are siblings. Once siblings are found, their parent is the LCA of the pair. Then the parent's parent can be found by taking their parent and another node, and so on.

So the steps could be:

1. Find all pairs of nodes that are siblings (i.e., their LCA is their parent).

2. For each such pair, their parent is known. Then, group the parents and find their siblings, etc., until reaching the root.

But how to find sibling pairs.

A sibling pair (u, v) has their LCA as their parent. So when you query u and v, you get their parent. Then, the parent is part of the tree, and you can build the hierarchy.

But how to efficiently find such sibling pairs.

One approach is to iterate through all possible pairs and check if their LCA is a certain node. But with O(N^2) pairs, this is not feasible for large N.

But perhaps, when n is up to 10, the number of nodes is 1023, which would require 1023*1023=1e6 queries. But 4800 is much less than that. So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by BFS:

Start by finding the root. Once the root is found, find its two children. Then for each child, find their two children, and so on. This way, building the tree level by level.

To find the root:

The root is the LCA of any two nodes that are in different subtrees. Suppose we take a group of nodes and query their pairwise LCAs. The root would be the highest possible LCA among those.

But how to find such a group.

Alternatively, pick a few nodes and query their pairwise LCAs. For example, pick 10 nodes and query all pairs. The LCA that is the most common and highest in the tree is the root candidate.

Once the root is found, split the remaining nodes into two groups: those in the left subtree and those in the right subtree. How?

For each node u in the remaining nodes, query LCA(u, root). If the LCA is root, then u is a child of the root's subtree. Wait, no. Wait, the LCA of u and the root is u's ancestor. If u is in the left or right subtree, then the LCA of u and the root is the root. Because the root is the ancestor of u. So this approach doesn't help.

Wait, no. The LCA of u and v is the deepest node that is an ancestor of both. If u is the root, then the LCA of u and any other node v is the root, since the root is the ancestor of all nodes. So this approach would not help in splitting the nodes into left and right subtrees.

So how to split the nodes into left and right subtrees once the root is known.

Another idea: For any node u (not the root), its parent is in the path from u to the root. The parent is the immediate ancestor of u. So to find the parent of u, perhaps we can find a node p such that p is the LCA of u and some other node v, and p is not the root. But this seems vague.

Alternatively, for the root's children, say left child L and right child R, any node in the left subtree of L will have their LCA with L as L. Wait, no. For example, if u is a node in the left subtree of L, then LCA(u, L) is L. Similarly for R.

So once the root is known, to find its children L and R, we can find nodes that have LCA with the root as the root's children.

Wait, no. The LCA of the root and any node is the root. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. This is getting tricky. Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the root. Then, for the root's two children, their parent is the root. So how to find those two children.

The two children must be such that their LCA is the root. But how to find which nodes they are.

Wait, for two nodes u and v that are children of the root, their LCA is the root. So if I query u and v, the LCA is the root.

But how to find such pairs.

So here's an approach:

1. Find the root r.

2. Collect all nodes except r into a list.

3. For each node u in the list, query the LCA of u and another node v (from the list). If their LCA is r, then u and v are in different subtrees (left and right). If their LCA is not r, then they are in the same subtree.

But how to find two nodes u and v whose LCA is r, thus indicating they are in different subtrees.

Once we have such a pair, we can split the nodes into those that are in the same subtree as u (left) and those in the same as v (right).

But how to do this efficiently.

Another idea: For the root's children (L and R), their own children are the next level. So, for each node u, if the LCA of u and L is L, then u is in L's subtree. Otherwise, if LCA(u, R) is R, then u is in R's subtree. But how to find L and R.

Alternatively, once the root is found, we need to find its two children. These two children are the ones that when paired together, their LCA is the root. So, for all pairs of nodes (excluding the root), check if their LCA is the root. Those pairs must consist of one left child and one right child. But how to find two such nodes.

Once we find such a pair (u, v), then one is in the left subtree and the other in the right. But how to determine which is which.

Alternatively, we can split the nodes into two groups: those whose LCA with u is the root, and those whose LCA with v is the root.

Wait, no. Because if u is in the left subtree, then any node in the left subtree will have LCA with u as some node in the left subtree. The LCA with u and any node in the right subtree is the root.

So, for node u in the left subtree, and node v in the right subtree:

LCA(u, v) = root.

LCA(u, w), where w is in the left subtree: LCA is in the left subtree.

So, if we can find one node in the left subtree and one in the right, we can split the rest of the nodes by querying their LCA with u or v.

But how to find such a pair u and v.

Here's a plan:

1. Find the root r.

2. Select any node u (not r). Query LCA(u, r). Since r is the ancestor of u, the result is u's ancestor. But this query will return the LCA of u and r, which is r. Because the LCA of u and r is r. So this doesn't help.

Wait, no. The LCA of u and r is r. So querying u and r always returns r. That's not helpful.

Alternative approach: For the root's children, L and R. We need to find two nodes L and R that are children of the root.

For any node x, to check if x is a child of the root, we need to find if there exists a node y such that LCA(x, y) is the root, and x and y are siblings (their parent is the root). But this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, to find the root's children, we can find two nodes that are siblings (their LCA is their parent, which is the root).

So, the root's children are the pairs of nodes whose LCA is the root.

Wait, no. If two nodes u and v are in different subtrees (left and right), then their LCA is the root. But if they are siblings (children of the root), then yes, their LCA is the root.

So any pair of nodes from different subtrees will have their LCA as the root. But this includes not just the direct children but any pairs from different subtrees.

So finding the root's children is difficult.

Alternative approach:

We need to build the tree level by level. Starting from the root, then the children of the root, then their children, etc.

At each step, for a node p, find its left and right children.

How to find the children of p:

The children of p are the nodes in the subtree of p that are directly connected to p. But how to determine this.

For a node p, its left child is a node u such that for all nodes v in the left subtree of p, the LCA of u and v is u (if u is the parent of v), or some node in the subtree.

Alternatively, for the left child of p (say, L), the LCA of L and any node in the left subtree (excluding L's descendants) will be L. But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, for the children of p:

To find the left child of p, we need a node u such that the LCA of u and p is p (since p is the parent of u). But LCA(u, p) is u's ancestor. So if u is a child of p, then LCA(u, p) is p.

So for any node u, if the LCA of u and p is p, then u is a descendant of p. So if we have p, then any node u where LCA(u, p) is p is in p's subtree.

But to find the children of p, we need nodes u where p is their parent.

But how to find these nodes.

Another idea: For each node u, if the LCA of u and any node in p's subtree (other than p) is in p's subtree, then u is in p's subtree.

But again, not helpful.

Alternative approach inspired by the following observation: For a node p and its two children L and R, any node in L's subtree will have their LCA with R as p. Similarly for nodes in R's subtree.

But how to use this.

Hmm.

Perhaps another angle: For any node u, the parent of u is the node p such that p is the LCA of u and any node in the other subtree of p.

For example, if u is in the left subtree of p, then any node in the right subtree of p will have their LCA with u as p.

So to find the parent of u, find a node p such that there exists a node v where LCA(u, v) = p. Then, check if u's parent is p.

But how to verify if p is indeed the parent.

Alternatively, if the parent of u is p, then for any node v not in p's subtree, the LCA of u and v would be p's parent, and so on. But this is getting too vague.

Maybe it's time to look for some existing algorithm or strategy for this problem.

Alternatively, think of the problem as similar to building a binary tree using LCA information. Some research papers might exist, but since I can't look them up now, I need to think of an approach.

An alternative approach:

For each node, determine its depth. The root has depth 1, its children depth 2, etc. Once depths are known, nodes can be grouped by depth, and then their parents can be determined.

But how to find the depth of a node.

The depth of a node u is the number of edges from the root to u. The LCA of u and the root is the root. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, the depth of a node can be determined by the number of times it appears as an LCA in certain queries. But not sure.

Another observation: For any two nodes u and v, the LCA's depth is the highest (smallest) depth among their common ancestors. So, if two nodes are in the same level, their LCA is a higher-level node.

But again, how to use this.

Alternative idea inspired by the fact that in a full binary tree, the structure is known. The ID permutation is the only unknown. So perhaps we can assign each node to a position in the binary tree structure and then determine the mapping from ID to position.

But how?

For example, the full binary tree can be represented in an array-like structure where the root is at position 1, left child is 2, right is 3, and so on. Each node at position i has left child 2i and right child 2i+1.

But the problem is that the IDs are a permutation of 1..2^n-1. So, we need to find for each ID, what position (like 1, 2, 3, etc.) it occupies in the standard binary heap structure.

Once we know this, the parent of each ID can be determined based on their position. For example, a node at position i has parent at position floor(i/2), which in ID terms is the parent's ID.

So the problem reduces to finding the permutation from position to ID. For example, pos_1 is the root's ID, pos_2 is the left child of the root's ID, etc.

So if we can find this permutation, then the parent of a node is simply the ID corresponding to floor(i/2), and if i is 1 (root), the parent is -1.

So the problem is now to find the permutation pos[1..2^n-1], where pos[i] is the ID of the node at position i.

Once we have pos, the answer is straightforward: for each ID j, find its position i (where pos[i] = j), then the parent's position is floor(i/2). If i is 1, parent is -1. Otherwise, the parent's ID is pos[floor(i/2)].

So the key is to determine the permutation pos.

Now, how to find pos using LCA queries.

The LCA of two nodes pos[i] and pos[j] is pos[k], where k is the LCA of the nodes i and j in the standard binary tree structure.

For example, in the standard binary tree structure, the LCA of nodes at positions 4 and 5 is position 2 (their parent). The LCA of positions 4 and 6 is 1 (the root).

So, if we can find the LCA of two nodes' IDs, we can map it to the LCA of their positions and find the permutation.

So, the plan is:

1. Determine the permutation pos by comparing the LCAs of pairs of IDs and matching them to the expected LCA in the standard binary tree structure.

But how?

For example, if we can find the root (pos[1]), then its children are pos[2] and pos[3]. Their children are pos[4], pos[5], pos[6], pos[7], etc.

But how to map the IDs to their positions.

Another approach is to build the permutation pos layer by layer. Starting with the root (pos[1]), then pos[2] and pos[3], then their children, etc.

So:

- Determine pos[1] (root).

- Determine pos[2] and pos[3] (root's children).

- Determine pos[4], pos[5], pos[6], pos[7] (children of pos[2] and pos[3]), and so on.

To determine each pos[i], we need to find the ID that corresponds to position i.

But how to do this with LCA queries.

For example, pos[2] and pos[3] are children of pos[1]. So the LCA of pos[2] and pos[3] is pos[1].

Similarly, the LCA of pos[4] and pos[5] is pos[2], the LCA of pos[6] and pos[7] is pos[3], etc.

So, for a node at position i, its left child is 2i, right child is 2i+1. The parent of i is floor(i/2).

So, the LCA of nodes at positions a and b in the standard binary tree is the same as the LCA of their IDs pos[a] and pos[b].

Thus, for any two nodes with positions i and j, the LCA of their IDs is the ID of the LCA of i and j in the standard binary tree.

So, if we can find for each node's ID, its position in the standard tree, then the parent can be determined.

So the problem reduces to determining the permutation pos.

Now, how to find pos using LCA queries.

Here's an approach inspired by BFS:

1. Find pos[1] (root). This is the ID that is the LCA of any two nodes from different subtrees.

2. Once the root is known, find its two children (pos[2] and pos[3]). These are the two IDs where their LCA is pos[1].

3. For each level from 2 to n, for each node in that level, find its two children.

But how to find the children of a node in this way.

For example, suppose we have pos[i], and we want to find pos[2i] and pos[2i+1]. These two nodes are the children of pos[i]. The LCA of pos[2i] and pos[2i+1] is pos[i].

So, for each node pos[i], we need to find two IDs u and v such that LCA(u, v) = pos[i].

But how to find such pairs.

Alternatively, once we know pos[i], we can find its children by finding two nodes u and v whose LCA is pos[i]. But how to ensure that they are the children and not other nodes in the subtree.

But in the standard tree, the children of pos[i] are the only two nodes whose LCA with each other is pos[i]. All other pairs in the subtree would have their LCA at a deeper node.

So for each pos[i], we need to find two nodes whose LCA is pos[i], and are not in any subtree deeper than i's children.

This seems challenging.

Another idea: For the root, once found, we can split all other nodes into left and right subtrees. For each subtree, the root is one of the root's children. So recursively, we can build the entire tree.

But how to split into left and right subtrees.

For example, once we have pos[1], the root, the left subtree consists of nodes in positions 2, 4, 5, 8, etc. (left subtree of the root), and the right subtree consists of nodes 3, 6,7, etc.

So, for any node u in the left subtree of the root, the LCA of u and any node in the right subtree is the root. For any two nodes in the left subtree, their LCA is within the left subtree.

So, to split the nodes into left and right subtrees after finding the root, we can pick a node and see if it's in the left or right subtree.

But how?

Suppose we pick a node u. If the LCA of u and pos[2] is pos[2], then u is in the left subtree. If the LCA of u and pos[3] is pos[3], then u is in the right subtree.

But how do we find pos[2] and pos[3] in the first place?

Ah, this is the crux. Once we have the root, we need to find its two children. These children are the roots of the left and right subtrees.

So, for the root's children:

We need to find two nodes u and v such that their LCA is the root. Additionally, these two nodes are the root's children.

But how?

The root's children are the only nodes whose parent is the root. For any other pair of nodes whose LCA is the root, they are in different subtrees but may be deeper.

But the root's children are the only nodes at level 2.

So, for the root's children, any pair of nodes in level 2 would have their LCA as the root.

But how to find such pairs.

Alternatively, the root's children are the only nodes that are the LCA of two nodes in their respective subtrees.

But this seems not helpful.

Maybe a different approach is needed.

Alternative approach inspired by the standard binary heap structure:

Each node in the standard binary tree has a unique path from the root (e.g., left, left, right, etc.), which can be represented as a binary string. The ID of each node is pos[i], where i is the position in the standard tree.

The key is to find the mapping between i and pos[i].

For each node pos[i], its left child is pos[2i], and right child is pos[2i+1]. So, once we find the children of each node, we can build the tree.

So the plan is to build the tree level by level, starting from the root, then its children, then their children, etc.

To find the children of a node pos[i], we need to find two nodes u and v such that their LCA is pos[i], and they are not part of any higher level's nodes.

But how.

Another idea: For each node, its children can be found by querying the LCA of all possible pairs in the remaining nodes. But this is too expensive.

Alternatively, once the root is found, to find its children, we can find all nodes that are in the next level (level 2). These nodes are the root's children and are the only ones in level 2. So, for each node u, if the LCA of u and the root is u, then u is in the root's subtree, but that's true for all nodes except the root. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the depth of a node is its level in the tree. The root is level 1, children level 2, etc. The depth of a node can be determined by the number of ancestors it has. For example, the depth is 1 for the root, 2 for its children, and so on.

But how to determine the depth of a node.

For a node u, its depth is equal to the depth of its parent plus 1. So if we can find the parent of u, we can determine its depth.

But again, this requires knowing the parent first.

Alternatively, here's a method inspired by BFS:

1. Find the root (level 1).

2. For level 2: find the root's children (left and right).

3. For each node in level 2, find their children (level 3), and so on.

But how to find the children for each node.

For a node p in level k, its children are two nodes in level k+1. To find them, we need to find nodes u and v such that their LCA is p, and their LCA with any other node not in p's subtree is p's parent.

But this is not helpful.

Alternative idea for children:

For node p, to find its left child:

Find a node u such that LCA(u, p) is p. Then, u is in p's subtree. But to be a left child, u must be at depth (p's depth + 1).

But how to determine this.

Alternatively, for the children of p, any node u in the subtree of p's left child will have their LCA with p's left child as the left child. But this requires knowing p's left child.

This is getting too circular.

At this point, I'm stuck. I need to think of a different approach.

Another observation: The number of queries allowed is 4800. For n=10, the tree has 1023 nodes. So, per node, we can afford about 4-5 queries. So, the algorithm must be O(n) per node, or O(n log n) overall.

Hmm. Let's think of the following approach:

1. Find the root. To do this, pick a pair of nodes and find their LCA. If their LCA is x, then x is a candidate. But how to find the root.

Wait, here's a method to find the root:

The root is the LCA of all possible pairs of nodes. But this is not efficient.

Alternatively, pick a few nodes and find their pairwise LCAs. The highest LCA (the one that is the ancestor of all others) is the root.

For example, pick three nodes: a, b, c.

Find LCA(a, b) = x.

Find LCA(x, c) = y.

If y is x, then x is the ancestor of c. So x is a candidate for being the root. Otherwise, y is higher than x. Repeat this process until no higher node is found.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, start with two nodes a and b. Find their LCA x. Then, find the LCA of x and another node c. Repeat this until you can't go higher. The final node is the root.

This would require O(n) queries for this process.

For example, if the initial nodes are a and b, LCA is x. Then, take a new node c, find LCA(x, c) = y. If y is deeper than x, then x is higher (wait, no). If the LCA of x and c is y, which is higher than x, then y is the new candidate. Repeat until the candidate remains the same.

But how to measure higher or lower without knowing the structure.

Alternatively, the root is the LCA of any node with any other node. So, the root is the LCA of a and b, then the LCA of the result with c, etc. So, this process would converge to the root.

For example, if we have nodes a, b, c, d, e. LCA(a, b) = x, LCA(x, c) = y, LCA(y, d) = z, etc., until no change. The final result would be the root.

This could be a way to find the root.

Once the root is found, proceed to find the children for each level.

But how.

After finding the root, the next step is to find its two children. Let's call them L and R.

To find L and R:

- Any pair of nodes whose LCA is the root must include one from the left and one from the right subtree.

But how to find two nodes that are direct children.

For example, if I take a node u and query its LCA with the root. Since the root is the ancestor of u, the LCA is the root. So this is not helpful.

Alternative idea: For nodes in the left subtree of the root, their LCA with any node in the right subtree is the root. But for nodes in the same subtree, their LCA is deeper.

So, to find a node in the left subtree, I can pick a node u and find a node v such that their LCA is the root. Then, u is in the left subtree and v in the right, or vice versa.

But how to find such pairs.

Once I have two nodes u and v such that LCA(u, v) is the root, then I can split the remaining nodes into those that are in the same subtree as u and those as v.

For example:

Take all nodes except the root. For each node w:

- Query LCA(u, w). If it's the root, then w is in the right subtree (since u is in the left). If it's u, then w is in u's subtree (left subtree).

- Similarly for other nodes.

This way, I can split the nodes into left and right subtrees.

Once split, recursively process each subtree.

But how to implement this.

So, the steps would be:

1. Find the root r.

2. Find a node u in the left subtree and a node v in the right subtree. For example, by checking pairs until we find a pair with LCA r.

3. Split all nodes into left and right subtrees based on their LCA with u and v.

4. For each subtree, recursively find their root (which is the child of r) and repeat the process.

But how to find u and v.

To find u and v in step 2, we can iterate through pairs of nodes and query their LCA. Once we find a pair (u, v) where LCA(u, v) = r, then u is in left and v in right (or vice versa). Once found, we can use these two nodes to split the rest.

But how many queries would this take.

For example, if we have 1022 nodes (excluding the root), and we randomly pick pairs, how likely are we to find a pair in left and right quickly.

In the worst case, this could take O(N) queries, but for n=10, it's manageable.

Once u and v are found, then for any other node w, query LCA(u, w). If the result is r, then w is in the right subtree. If it's u, then w is in the left subtree.

But wait, if w is in the left subtree, then LCA(u, w) will be the LCA of u and w within the left subtree. For example, if u and w are siblings in the left subtree, their LCA is their parent (a child of the root). So the LCA(u, w) would not be the root. So this approach would not work.

Ah, right. Because u is in the left subtree of the root. So for any node w in the left subtree, their LCA is in the left subtree, not the root.

So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm. So the previous plan is flawed.

Alternative idea: To split the nodes into left and right subtrees, we need to find all nodes in the left subtree and all in the right. But once the root's children are known, the rest can be processed.

So the key is to find the root's children.

Once the root's children L and R are known, the left subtree is rooted at L and the right at R.

So the problem now is to find L and R.

How to find L and R:

L and R are the children of the root. Their LCA is the root. So, any pair of nodes whose LCA is the root could be L and R or any deeper pair in the left and right subtrees.

So, how to distinguish between L and R and deeper pairs.

But the children of the root are the only nodes in level 2. All other nodes in the left and right subtrees are deeper.

So, the children of the root are the nodes that have no children except those in deeper levels.

But how to find this.

Alternatively, for each node u, if the LCA of u and the root is u, then u is in the subtree of the root. But this is true for all nodes except the root.

Not helpful.

Another idea: For the children of the root (L and R), their children would be in the next level (level 3). So, for each node u, if there exists a pair of nodes whose LCA is u, then u is a parent in level 2.

But this requires querying all possible pairs.

This is getting too time-consuming.

Alternative approach inspired by the standard binary heap structure:

The root is pos[1].

pos[2] and pos[3] are its children.

pos[4], pos[5] are children of pos[2], pos[6], pos[7] are children of pos[3], and so on.

Thus, the left child of pos[i] is pos[2i], and the right is pos[2i+1].

So, if we can determine the pos[i] for each position i, then the parent array can be easily constructed.

The key is to determine the permutation pos.

So, how to find pos[i] for each i using LCA queries.

For the root (i=1), pos[1] is the LCA of any two nodes from different subtrees.

For pos[2], the left child of the root, it's the LCA of any two nodes from the left subtree of the root.

But this is not true. The LCA of two nodes in the left subtree of the root is their LCA within the left subtree.

Hmm.

But in terms of the standard tree, the LCA of two nodes in the left subtree (pos[2]'s subtree) is pos[2] if they are in different subtrees of pos[2].

So, perhaps for each position i, the pos[i] can be found by querying the LCA of two nodes in its left and right subtrees.

But how.

Alternatively, the LCA of pos[2i] and pos[2i+1] is pos[i].

So, for each i, the children of pos[i] are the pair of nodes whose LCA is pos[i].

Thus, the plan is to determine the children for each node in a BFS-like manner.

Start with the root.

For each node pos[i] in the current level, find two nodes u and v such that their LCA is pos[i]. These nodes will be pos[2i] and pos[2i+1], the children of pos[i].

Once all children are found for the current level, move to the next level.

This approach requires O(2^{n-1}) queries for each level, which for n=10 would be 512 queries for the leaves (level 10 has 512 nodes). But since the number of nodes per level doubles each level, the total number of queries would be 1+2+4+8+...+512 = 1023 queries, which is within the 4800 limit.

But how to implement this.

The steps would be:

1. Find the root pos[1].

2. For each level from 1 to n-1:

   a. For each node pos[i] in the current level:

      i. Find two nodes u and v such that LCA(u, v) = pos[i].

      ii. Assign u and v as pos[2i] and pos[2i+1].

But how to find u and v for each pos[i].

The problem is that the nodes in the subtree of pos[i] are not yet identified. So for step i, when we need to find two nodes in pos[i]'s subtree whose LCA is pos[i], how do we do this.

But according to the standard tree structure, pos[2i] and pos[2i+1] are the only two nodes whose LCA is pos[i]. All other pairs in their subtree will have a deeper LCA.

So, to find the children of pos[i], we need to find two nodes u and v such that their LCA is pos[i], and they are not in any other subtree.

But this is not directly helpful.

But perhaps, once the parent nodes are known up to level k, the children can be found by querying pairs of nodes that have not yet been assigned to a parent.

For example:

After finding the root, we need to find its two children. We can query pairs of unassigned nodes. If their LCA is the root, then they are the root's children.

But wait, no. Any pair of nodes from left and right subtrees will have their LCA as the root. So this could include many pairs.

But the root's children are the first-level nodes. Any pair consisting of a left child and a right child would have their LCA as the root. So this approach would find many pairs, but we need to find the two children.

But how.

Alternatively, the root's children are the nodes that are the LCA of no other pairs. Because their LCA is the root.

But this is not true.

Alternatively, the root's children are the only two nodes in the entire tree that have their parent as the root. So, if we can find all nodes whose parent is the root, those are the two children.

But to find the parent of a node u, we need to find the LCA of u and any node in the other subtree. For example, if u is in the left subtree, then any node in the right subtree will have their LCA with u as the root. So the parent of u must be the root's left child.

So, for a node u, if the LCA of u and any node in the right subtree is the root, then u's parent is the root's left child.

But how to determine this.

This is getting too complicated.

At this point, I think I need to look for a different strategy.

Let's think of the problem in terms of the standard binary tree structure, and model the problem as finding the mapping between the positions and the IDs.

The key insight is that for any two nodes in the standard tree, their LCA in the ID tree corresponds to the LCA in the standard tree. So, if I can query pairs of IDs and map their LCAs to positions, I can build the permutation.

But how to do this.

Another approach is to use the fact that for the standard tree, the LCA of positions i and j is the position of the LCA in the standard tree. So, for example, if I have a node at position i, its parent is floor(i/2).

Thus, for each position i, we can compute its parent in the standard tree. Then, the problem is to find the ID of the parent of each node.

But how to find the ID of the parent of a node u.

The parent of u in the standard tree is the node's position divided by 2. So, for example, if u is in position 5, its parent is 2.

But in the ID mapping, the parent's ID is pos[2].

But how to determine pos[2], which is the left child of the root.

Hmm.

Alternatively, for each node's ID, to find its parent's ID, we can find the LCA of this node and another node from the other subtree of its parent.

But this requires knowing which nodes are in the other subtree.

This is a chicken and egg problem.

Perhaps the best approach is to implement the following steps:

1. Find the root.

2. For each node in BFS order (starting from the root), find its two children by finding two nodes whose LCA is the current node.

This would require, for each node, to find two nodes that are its children.

But how to find two nodes whose LCA is the current node.

Let's say we are processing node p. To find its children, we can look for pairs of nodes in the unprocessed nodes whose LCA is p. Once we find two such nodes, they are p's children.

But how to efficiently find these pairs.

For example, after processing the root, we need to find two nodes whose LCA is the root. These are the root's children.

But in reality, any pair of nodes from the left and right subtree would have LCA root. But the root's children are the only ones in level 2.

So, how to find the root's children.

Once the root is known, any pair of nodes in the left and right subtree will have LCA root. But the root's children are the only nodes in level 2, so their LCA with each other is the root.

But how to distinguish them from other nodes in deeper levels.

So, the root's children are the only nodes in level 2. Any pair of nodes in level 2 would have LCA root.

So, if we can find two nodes in level 2, their LCA is the root. Once we find such a pair, they are the root's children.

But how.

Assuming that we have a list of all nodes except the root, we can start querying pairs until we find a pair whose LCA is the root. Those two nodes are the root's children.

Once we find the root's children, we can then find their children in the same way.

But this process would require O(1) queries per pair, which could be manageable.

For example, for the root's children:

We have a list of remaining nodes (1022 for n=10). We can iterate through pairs of these nodes and query their LCA until we find a pair with LCA equal to the root. This pair will be the root's children.

Once found, we can assign them as left and right children (order doesn't matter as long as the tree is built correctly).

Then, for each of these children, we repeat the process: find pairs in the remaining nodes whose LCA is the child, which will be their children.

This seems feasible.

The number of queries would be:

For each node (except leaves), we need to find two children. For each child pair, the number of queries needed to find them is O(1) if we can find them quickly.

But in the worst case, for each pair, it might require O(M) queries, where M is the number of remaining nodes.

But with n=10, the total number of nodes is 1023. The number of non-leaf nodes is 512. For each non-leaf node, we need to find two children.

So for each of the 511 non-leaf nodes (since root is level 1 and leaves are level n), we need to find two children. For each child, we need to find a pair in the remaining nodes whose LCA is the current node.

But how to find these pairs efficiently.

The problem is that for a node p, any two nodes in its left and right subtree will have LCA p. But these nodes may be at any depth in the subtree.

For example, if p is in level 2, its children are in level 3. But nodes in level 4 could also have their LCA as p if they are in different subtrees of p.

So, for node p, to find its children, we need to find two nodes in level 3. But how to find them.

Alternatively, the children of p are the only nodes that are in the next level and are directly connected to p. All other nodes in p's subtree are deeper.

So, perhaps for node p, we can search for pairs of nodes in the remaining list whose LCA is p, and those pairs are siblings (their LCA is p, and their own LCA is p).

But how.

Alternatively, for node p, its children are the nodes u and v such that their LCA is p, and the LCA of u and any other node is not p.

But this is not necessarily true.

At this point, I think the best way to proceed is to implement the following algorithm:

1. Find the root.

   a. Pick a few nodes, query their pairwise LCAs. The root is the one that appears as the highest LCA.

   b. For example, pick nodes 1, 2, 3, etc., query their pairwise LCAs, and find the one that is the LCA of all others. This would be the root.

2. Once the root is known, find its children.

   a. Iterate through all possible pairs of remaining nodes, query their LCA. If the LCA is the root, then they are the root's children.

   b. Once two such nodes are found, assign them as left and right children.

3. For each child of the root, find their children by finding pairs of nodes whose LCA is the child.

4. Repeat this process until all nodes are processed.

But how to implement this efficiently.

The key is to manage the remaining nodes and for each node, track whether they have been assigned to a parent.

For example, maintain a list of unprocessed nodes. For each node p in the current level:

   a. Find two nodes u and v in the unprocessed list such that LCA(u, v) == p.

   b. Assign u and v as p's children.

   c. Remove u and v from the unprocessed list.

But how to find u and v quickly.

But this requires, for each p, to find two nodes in the unprocessed list whose LCA is p. This could take O(M^2) queries per p, which is not feasible.

But with the 4800 query limit, this approach is not feasible for large n.

Thus, this approach is only feasible for small n.

But the problem allows n up to 10, which is 1023 nodes. Thus, this approach won't work for large n.

Another idea: Use the fact that the tree is a full binary tree, and the children of a node are the nodes that are in the same subtree and have not been assigned yet.

But I'm not seeing how to exploit this.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to think of a different approach.

Wait, the interactor is not adaptive. This means that the tree structure is fixed at the beginning and does not change based on my queries. This allows me to precompute the structure based on the fixed tree.

But how does this help.

The problem requires me to determine the parent array for the given permutation of the full binary tree.

An alternative approach inspired by the following:

Each node's parent is the LCA of that node and any node from the other subtree of the parent.

So, for node u, if I can find a node v such that LCA(u, v) = p, then p is the parent of u.

But how to find such a v.

Alternatively, for node u, if I query the LCA of u and all other nodes. The parent of u is the node that is the LCA of u and any node from the other subtree of the parent.

So, for example, if u is in the left subtree of p, then any node in the right subtree of p will have LCA(u, v) = p.

Thus, the parent of u is p.

So, for node u, if I can find any node v such that LCA(u, v) = p, and p is the deepest such node, then p is the parent of u.

But how to find such a v.

But this requires querying u with many nodes, which is expensive.

But perhaps, for each node u, I can find the node v that is in the other subtree of its parent. Once such a v is found, LCA(u, v) will be the parent of u.

But how to find such a v.

Alternatively, for each node u, if I can find a node v that is not in the same subtree as u, then LCA(u, v) will be the parent of u or higher.

But again, not helpful.

But perhaps for a node u, the parent p is the LCA of u and any node not in the subtree of u.

But how to find such a node.

Alternatively, for a node u, if I can find a node v such that LCA(u, v) = p, and there is no other node with LCA(u, v) deeper than p, then p is the parent of u.

But this requires knowing the tree structure.

At this point, I think the solution requires an approach that builds the tree level by level, using the BFS approach, and for each node, finding its children by querying pairs of nodes whose LCA is the current node.

But to do this efficiently, we can keep track of the nodes in each level and process them in BFS order.

The algorithm would be as follows:

Initialize:

- Root is found.

- Processed nodes: {root}

- Unprocessed nodes: all others.

- Queue: [root]

While queue is not empty:

   current_node = queue.pop(0)

   find two nodes u and v in unprocessed such that LCA(u, v) = current_node

   assign u and v as children of current_node

   add u and v to processed and queue

   remove u and v from unprocessed

But how to find u and v.

The key step is finding two nodes in unprocessed whose LCA is current_node. To find these, we can iterate through all pairs in unprocessed and query their LCA. Once a pair with LCA current_node is found, they are the children.

But for n=10, unprocessed can have up to 1022 nodes. The number of pairs is 1022*1021/2, which is around 5e5 for the first iteration. This is way too many queries.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the fact that the children of current_node are the only nodes in the unprocessed list whose LCA is current_node. But how to find them efficiently.

Another observation: In the standard binary tree, the children of a node are the first two nodes encountered in the unprocessed list that are in the left and right subtrees of the node.

But this is not applicable.

Another idea: For each node current_node, its children are the first two nodes in the unprocessed list that have current_node as their parent.

But how to find this.

The parent of a node u is the LCA of u and any node not in u's subtree.

But how to find this.

Alternatively, for a node u, if current_node is its parent, then the LCA of u and any node in the other subtree of current_node is current_node.

But this requires knowing the other subtree.

At this point, I think I need to find a different approach. Let's consider the following:

The parent of node u can be determined by finding the node p such that p is the LCA of u and any other node in the other subtree of p.

So, for example, if u is in the left subtree of p, then any node in the right subtree of p will have LCA(u, v) = p.

But how to find such a v.

But this requires knowing the other subtree.

But if we have the root and its children, then we can split the nodes into left and right subtrees. Then, for each subtree, we can recursively find the children.

But how to split the subtrees.

Once the root's children L and R are found, the left subtree is all nodes in the subtree of L, and the right subtree is all nodes in the subtree of R.

To split the nodes into left and right subtrees:

For each node u in unprocessed list:

   query LCA(u, L) 

   if the result is L, then u is in the left subtree of L.

   else, if the result is root, then u is in the left subtree of the root (since L is in the left subtree).

Wait, no. LCA(u, L) will be L if u is in the subtree of L. Otherwise, it will be root.

So, for example, if u is in the left subtree of L, LCA(u, L) is L. If u is in the right subtree of L, LCA(u, L) is L.

Wait, no. If u is in the left subtree of L, then L is the ancestor of u. So their LCA is L. If u is in the right subtree of L, then their LCA is L. If u is in the right subtree of the root (R's subtree), then LCA(u, L) is root.

Ah, right! So, for any node u in the left subtree of the root (L's subtree), the LCA of u and L is L if u is in L's subtree. If u is in the right subtree of the root (R's subtree), the LCA of u and L is root.

So, to split the remaining nodes into left and right subtrees:

For each node u in unprocessed:

   query LCA(u, L). If the result is L → u is in left subtree of root (L's subtree).

   else → u is in right subtree of root (R's subtree).

Once the nodes are split into left and right, then for each subtree, we can recursively find their structure.

So the algorithm is:

1. Find the root.

2. Find its children L and R.

3. Split all other nodes into left and right subtrees by querying LCA with L.

4. Recursively process left and right subtrees.

But how to find L and R.

To find L and R:

After finding the root, we need to find two nodes whose LCA is the root. These will be L and R.

Once we find such a pair, we can split the nodes.

But how to find L and R.

Once the root is known, the children L and R are the only nodes in level 2. So any pair of nodes in level 2 will have their LCA as the root.

But how to find such a pair.

We can iterate through pairs of unprocessed nodes (all except root) and query their LCA. Once a pair is found where LCA is root, those are L and R.

Once L and R are found, we can split the remaining nodes.

For example, in the sample input, after the root is found (3), the children are 1 and 2. Any pair of nodes in the sample (1 and 2) have LCA 3.

Thus, to find L and R, we can pick any two nodes, query their LCA. If it's the root, they are L and R.

But how many queries would this take.

In the worst case, we have to check O(N^2) pairs. But for the sample, it's done in 3 queries.

But for n=10, this could take O( (2^{10})^2 ) = 1e6 queries, which is way over the limit.

Thus, this approach is not feasible for large n.

But what if the number of queries is manageable for small n.

Perhaps, for small n (n up to 10), the algorithm is feasible.

But for n=10, 1023 nodes, the number of pairs is ~5e5, which is way over the 4800 limit.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the fact that the children of the root are the only nodes in the unprocessed list that are in level 2. So, their LCA with the root is the root (since the root is their parent). So, for any node u, if the LCA of u and the root is u's parent.

But how to determine this.

For the root's children L and R, their LCA with the root is the root (since the root is their parent).

But this is true for all nodes, because the root is the ancestor of all nodes. So, this is not helpful.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think I need to look for a different approach or find a way to model the problem with the given query constraints.

Finally, I think the correct approach is to use the following method:

1. Find the root by querying pairs of nodes and taking their LCA until we find a node that is the LCA of all pairs.

2. For each node in BFS order, find its two children by finding two nodes whose LCA is the current node.

But to do this efficiently, for each node, we can pick two arbitrary nodes from the unprocessed list and query their LCA. If it's the current node, assign them as children. Otherwise, continue.

But this could take O(M) queries per node, which for n=10 is manageable.

But how to manage this.

Alternatively, for each node, select two arbitrary nodes and query their LCA. If it's the current node, assign them as children. This is possible because the tree is a full binary tree, so each node must have exactly two children.

But for n=10, this would require 2*511=1022 queries (since there are 511 non-leaf nodes). This is within the 4800 query limit.

But how to find the two children for each node.

Wait, for each non-leaf node p, the two children must be in the list of unprocessed nodes. So, for each p, we need to find two nodes u and v such that LCA(u, v) = p.

But how to find these nodes.

But in the standard binary tree, the children of p are the first two nodes in the unprocessed list that are in the left and right subtrees of p.

But how to find this.

Alternatively, for each node p, its children are the next two nodes in the unprocessed list. So, we can process the unprocessed nodes in order, and for each p, take the first two nodes and check if their LCA is p. If yes, assign them as children. If not, then there's a problem.

But this approach is not guaranteed to work.

Alternatively, for each node p, its children are the next two nodes in the unprocessed list. So, we can query the LCA of these two nodes. If it's p, assign them as children. If not, then these two nodes are not children of p, and we need to find other pairs.

But this could lead to a lot of queries.

But perhaps, the unprocessed nodes are ordered such that the children of p are the first two nodes. This would require the nodes to be ordered in BFS order.

But since the IDs are permuted, this is not possible.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to refer to possible solutions.

Upon some research, I recall that in a full binary tree, each node has two children. To build the tree, one approach is to find the root, then find its children by querying pairs of nodes to find those whose LCA is the root. Once the children are found, recursively process their subtrees.

But the problem is to find the root's children.

But how to find them efficiently.

An alternative approach for finding the root's children:

Once the root is known, the left and right children are the only nodes that have the root as their parent. So, for each node u, if the parent of u is the root, then u is a child.

Thus, for each node u, to determine if it's a child of the root, we can find if there exists a node v such that LCA(u, v) is the root, and u and v are siblings.

But this is circular.

Another idea: For the root's children L and R, any node in the left subtree of L will have their LCA with L as L. Similarly for R.

Thus, to find L and R:

1. For the root, select any two nodes u and v from the unprocessed list.

2. Query the LCA of u and v. If it's the root, then u and v are L and R.

3. If not, then both u and v are in the same subtree of the root. Thus, the LCA is in that subtree.

But this gives us no information about L and R.

Thus, this approach could take a lot of queries.

But for small n, it's manageable.

For example, in the sample input, the root is 3. The unprocessed nodes are 1 and 2. Querying LCA(1, 2) gives 3, so they are the children.

Thus, this approach works.

But for larger n, it may take more queries.

But given that 4800 queries are allowed, and for n=10, the number of nodes is 1023, perhaps this approach is feasible.

So, the steps are:

1. Find the root.

2. Find two nodes u and v in the unprocessed list whose LCA is the root. These are the root's children.

3. Split the remaining nodes into left and right subtrees based on their LCA with u and v.

4. Recursively process each subtree.

To find the root's children:

- Iterate through pairs of nodes in the unprocessed list and query their LCA. Once a pair with LCA equal to the root is found, assign them as L and R.

But how many queries this would take.

In the worst case, for n=10, the root's children are the first two nodes in the unprocessed list, and their LCA is the root. So it's one query.

But in the worst case, if the unprocessed list has all nodes in the left subtree except the root's children, then it could take O(M^2) queries.

But with 4800 queries allowed, and for n=10, perhaps this is feasible.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after finding the root, the root's children are the only nodes in the tree that have depth 2. So, the root's children are the nodes that are the LCA of any two nodes in their respective subtree.

But again, not helpful.

At this point, I think the best approach is to write code that implements the following steps:

1. Find the root by querying pairs of nodes until a common ancestor is found.

   a. Start with a few nodes, query their pairwise LCA. The root is the LCA of all possible pairs.

   b. For example, pick a few nodes and find their LCA. The highest LCA is the root.

2. Once the root is found, find its children by querying pairs of nodes in the unprocessed list until a pair with LCA equal to the root is found.

3. Split the remaining nodes into left and right subtrees based on their LCA with the children.

4. Recursively process each subtree.

But the code will need to handle this efficiently.

For example, the code can be structured as follows:

- Maintain a queue of nodes to process in BFS order.

- The root is the first node in the queue.

- For each node in the queue, find its two children by finding a pair of nodes whose LCA is the current node.

- Once children are found, add them to the queue.

- Continue until all nodes are processed.

To find the children of a node p:

- Iterate through pairs of nodes in the unprocessed list and query their LCA. Once a pair with LCA p is found, assign them as children and remove them from the unprocessed list.

But this could take O(M^2) queries for each node.

But given the query limit, this is not feasible for large n.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

An alternative approach is to use a divide and conquer strategy, recursively splitting the nodes into left and right subtrees and determining their structure.

But how.

Once the root and its children are known, the left and right subtrees can be processed recursively. For each subtree, the process is repeated: find the subtree's root (the child of the parent), find its children, and split.

This requires knowing how to split the nodes into the left and right subtrees.

For the root's left child L:

- The left subtree of L consists of nodes where LCA(u, L) is L.

- The right subtree of L consists of nodes where LCA(u, L) is the parent of L (the root).

But this is not the case. For example, any node in L's subtree will have LCA with L as L. Any node not in L's subtree will have LCA with L as the root.

So, to split the nodes into L's subtree:

- For each node u in the current left list, query LCA(u, L). If it's L, then u is in L's subtree. Else, it's in the right subtree.

But this requires O(N) queries per split.

For n=10, this would be O(2^10) = 1024 queries, which is manageable.

Thus, the algorithm can be:

function build_tree(parent, nodes):

   if len(nodes) == 0:

       return

   root = find_root(nodes)

   find children L and R of root:

       iterate pairs in nodes until find pair with LCA root

   split nodes into left and right:

       for each node u in nodes:

           if u == L or u == R:

               continue

           if LCA(u, L) == L:

               add to left_subtree

           else:

               add to right_subtree

   assign parent[L] = root

   assign parent[R] = root

   build_tree(left_subtree)

   build_tree(right_subtree)

But how to find the root.

But this is a recursive approach where the root of the current subtree is known.

Thus, the code would look something like this:

The main steps are:

- Find the root of the entire tree.

- Split into left and right subtrees.

- For each subtree, find its root (child of the parent), split into left and right, and so on.

But the initial root is the root of the entire tree.

But the problem is finding the root.

But once the root is found, the rest follows.

But how to find the root.

Thus, the code would look something like this:

The code would have to:

1. Find the root of the entire tree.

   a. Select a few nodes and find their pairwise LCAs.

   b. The root is the highest LCA.

   For example, select nodes 1, 2, 3. Find LCA(1, 2) = x, then LCA(x, 3) = y, and so on until the root is found.

2. Once the root is known, find its children.

3. Split the remaining nodes into left and right.

4. Process each subtree recursively.

But how to implement this.

This is a possible way to proceed.

The code would need to:

- Keep track of the parent of each node.

- For each subtree, process the nodes and find their parents.

But the main challenge is implementing this efficiently within the query limit.

In the sample input:

- The root is 3.

- The children are 1 and 2.

- The left subtree of 3 is {1}, and the right is {2}.

Thus, in the first split, nodes are split into left and right.

For each subtree, the root is the child of the root.

Thus, no further processing is needed for the sample.

But for larger trees, the process continues.

But this requires recursively processing each subtree.

Thus, the code can be written recursively.

But the key challenge is to find the root of each subtree and split the nodes.

But how to find the root of each subtree.

For example, the root of the left subtree is L, which is the child of the parent root.

Thus, the code would:

- For each subtree, the root is known (the child of the parent).

- Split the nodes into left and right subtrees based on their LCA with the root's children.

But how.

This is the same as the initial problem but on a smaller scale.

Thus, the code would recursively split each subtree into left and right.

But this approach requires O(n) levels of recursion and O(n) queries per level.

But for n=10, this is manageable.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

The code will have a function to process a subtree given the root and a list of nodes.

function process_subtree(root, nodes):

   if len(nodes) == 0:

       return

   // Find left and right children of root

   left_child, right_child = find_children(root, nodes)

   // Assign parent of left_child and right_child

   parent[left_child] = root

   parent[right_child] = root

   // Split remaining nodes into left and right subtrees

   left_subtree = []

   right_subtree = []

   for node in nodes:

       if node == left_child or node == right_child:

           continue

       lca = query_lca(node, left_child)

       if lca == left_child:

           left_subtree.append(node)

       else:

           right_subtree.append(node)

   // Recursively process left and right subtrees

   process_subtree(left_child, left_subtree)

   process_subtree(right_child, right_subtree)

Thus, the main steps are:

1. Find the root of the entire tree.

2. Find its children.

3. Split the nodes into left and right subtrees.

4. Recursively process each subtree.

The key functions are finding the root and finding the children.

The find_children function would iterate through pairs of nodes and query their LCA until a pair with LCA equal to the current root is found.

But for a subtree with m nodes, this could take O(m^2) queries.

But for large m, this is not feasible.

Thus, this approach is feasible only for small n.

But given the problem constraints, and the query limit of 4800, perhaps this approach is possible.

For example, for n=10, the total number of nodes is 1023. The root has two children. Each child has two children, and so on.

The number of nodes processed at each level:

Level 1: 1 node (root)

Level 2: 2 nodes (left and right children)

Level 3: 4 nodes

...

Level 10: 512 nodes.

The total number of nodes is 2^n -1 = 1023.

At each level, to find the two children of each node, we need to find two nodes in the current subtree.

But in the worst case, for each node in the current level, we need to query all pairs of remaining nodes until we find a pair whose LCA is the current node.

But with 4800 queries, this is possible.

But how many queries per node.

For example, for level 2, there are two children of the root. Each requires two nodes to be found. For the root's children, finding their children requires four nodes, and so on.

But the key is that for each node, the children are found by querying pairs of remaining nodes in the subtree until a pair with LCA equal to the current node is found.

But for each subtree, the number of nodes is halved each time.

For example, the root's left subtree has 511 nodes. Finding the root's children requires two nodes. Then, each of those children has two children, and so on.

Thus, the total number of queries is:

For each node in the tree (non-leaf), find two children.

For each child pair, the number of queries needed is the number of pairs that need to be checked until a pair with LCA equal to the parent is found.

In the best case, it's one query per pair. In the worst case, O(m^2) queries per node.

But with 4800 queries allowed, this is possible for n=10.

But I'm not sure.

Thus, the code would look something like:

def main():

   read n

   all_nodes = list(range(1, 2**n))

   // find root

   root = find_root(all_nodes)

   parent = [-1]*(2**n)

   nodes = [node for node in all_nodes if node != root]

   process_subtree(root, nodes)

   output parent array.

def find_root(nodes):

   // sample a few nodes and find their LCA.

   // for example, take first three nodes.

   a = nodes[0]

   b = nodes[1]

   c = nodes[2]

   x = query_lca(a, b)

   y = query_lca(x, c)

   // continue until no change.

   // but this is not guaranteed.

   // alternatively, pick pairs and track the highest LCA.

   // but this is not implemented here.

   return root

def process_subtree(current_root, nodes):

   if len(nodes) == 0:

       return

   // find two children

   left_child, right_child = find_children(current_root, nodes)

   parent[left_child] = current_root

   parent[right_child] = current_root

   // split nodes into left and right subtrees

   left_nodes = []

   right_nodes = []

   for node in nodes:

       if node == left_child or node == right_child:

           continue

       lca = query_lca(node, left_child)

       if lca == left_child:

           left_nodes.append(node)

       else:

           right_nodes.append(node)

   process_subtree(left_child, left_nodes)

   process_subtree(right_child, right_nodes)

def find_children(parent, nodes):

   // find two nodes in nodes whose LCA is parent.

   for i in range(len(nodes)):

       for j in range(i+1, len(nodes)):

           u = nodes[i]

           v = nodes[j]

           lca = query_lca(u, v)

           if lca == parent:

               // found children

               return u, v

   // if not found, error.

This is a rough outline of the code.

But the find_children function can take O(m^2) queries in the worst case. For m=511 (root's children), this is 511*510/2 = 130,000 queries, which is way over the 4800 limit.

Thus, this code is not feasible for large n.

At this point, I'm out of ideas. I think the correct approach is to use the fact that the tree is a full binary tree and assign the nodes based on their BFS order, but I'm not sure how to map this with the LCA queries.

An alternative approach is to use the following observation:

The parent of a node can be found by querying the LCA of the node and a specific other node. For example, for the standard binary tree, the parent of node i is floor(i/2). The ID of the parent is pos[floor(i/2)]. But since the IDs are permuted, we need to find this mapping.

Thus, the problem reduces to determining the permutation pos.

To determine pos, we can use the LCA queries to find the structure.

For example, the root is pos[1], and its children are pos[2] and pos[3]. The LCA of pos[2] and pos[3] is pos[1].

For pos[2], its children are pos[4] and pos[5]. The LCA of pos[4] and pos[5] is pos[2].

Similarly for other nodes.

Thus, for each position i, the children are pos[2i] and pos[2i+1], and their LCA is pos[i].

Thus, the permutation can be built by finding, for each i, the two nodes whose LCA is pos[i].

But how to implement this.

The approach is to build the permutation pos in BFS order.

Start with pos[1] = root.

For each i from 1 to 2^{n-1} - 1:

   find two nodes u and v whose LCA is pos[i].

   set pos[2i] = u

   set pos[2i+1] = v

Thus, the permutation can be built step by step.

But how to find u and v for each i.

To find u and v for pos[i], we need to find two nodes whose LCA is pos[i].

But how.

In the standard binary tree, the children of pos[i] are pos[2i] and pos[2i+1]. Their LCA is pos[i].

But in the ID tree, their LCA is pos[i].

Thus, for each i, we need to find two nodes whose LCA is pos[i], and assign them as pos[2i] and pos[2i+1].

Thus, the algorithm is:

1. Find the root (pos[1]).

2. For i from 1 to 2^{n-1} -1:

   a. Find two nodes u and v whose LCA is pos[i].

   b. Assign pos[2i] = u and pos[2i+1] = v.

This way, the permutation is built.

But how to find u and v for each i.

The key is that for each i, the children of pos[i] are the nodes whose LCA is pos[i].

But how to find these nodes.

At each step i, the unprocessed nodes are those not yet assigned to a position. For each i, we need to find two nodes in the unprocessed list whose LCA is pos[i].

Once found, assign them as pos[2i] and pos[2i+1].

But how to find these pairs.

This is the same as the previous problem.

Thus, the code would look something like:

pos = [0] * (2**n)

pos[1] = root

unprocessed = list of all nodes except root

for i in 1 to 2^{n-1} -1:

   // find two nodes u and v in unprocessed whose LCA is pos[i]

   u, v = find_pair_with_lca(pos[i], unprocessed)

   pos[2*i] = u

   pos[2*i + 1] = v

   unprocessed.remove(u)

   unprocessed.remove(v)

Thus, the problem is to find the pair u and v for each i.

The find_pair_with_lca function would iterate through pairs in unprocessed and query their LCA until a pair with LCA equal to pos[i] is found.

But this could take O(m^2) queries per i, which is not feasible.

But for small n, this is manageable.

For example, for n=10, there are 511 non-leaf nodes. For each, two children need to be found.

For each non-leaf node, the children are found by querying pairs in the unprocessed list until a pair with LCA equal to the current node is found.

Thus, the total number of queries is 511 * 1 = 511, assuming each pair is found in one query.

But this is optimistic.

In reality, for each pair, it could take multiple queries.

But 4800 is enough for 511 pairs.

Thus, this approach is feasible.

Thus, the code would proceed as follows:

1. Find the root.

2. Initialize pos[1] = root.

3. Initialize unprocessed list as all nodes except root.

4. For each i from 1 to 2^{n-1} -1:

   a. Iterate through all possible pairs of unprocessed nodes.

   b. Query their LCA.

   c. If LCA is pos[i], assign them as children.

   d. Remove them from unprocessed.

Thus, the code would be:

pos = [0]*(2**n)

pos[1] = root

unprocessed = list of all nodes except root

for i in range(1, 2**(n-1)):

   if len(unprocessed) < 2:

       break

   found = False

   for j in range(len(unprocessed)):

       for k in range(j+1, len(unprocessed)):

           u = unprocessed[j]

           v = unprocessed[k]

           lca = query_lca(u, v)

           if lca == pos[i]:

               pos[2*i] = u

               pos[2*i +1] = v

               unprocessed.remove(u)

               unprocessed.remove(v)

               found = True

               break

       if found:

           break

   if not found:

       // error

This code has O(M^2) time complexity per i, which is not feasible for large M.

But with 4800 queries, this is possible for small n.

But for n=10, M can be up to 1022, which makes this approach impossible.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to use the fact that the children of a node are the two nodes that have the highest depth in the subtree.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the parent of a node u is the LCA of u and any other node in the other subtree of the parent.

Thus, for each node u, if I can find a node v such that LCA(u, v) is p, then p is the parent of u.

But how to find such a v.

But the parent p of u is the LCA of u and any node in the other subtree.

Thus, for each node u, we can iterate through all other nodes and find the LCA. The parent of u is the LCA that is the shallowest.

But this requires O(N) queries per node, which is too much.

But perhaps, for each node u, we can find the LCA of u and the root. The LCA is the root. This tells us nothing.

Alternatively, for each node u, find the LCA of u and a node from the opposite subtree.

But how to know which node is from the opposite subtree.

Thus, I'm stuck.

In conclusion, the correct approach is to:

1. Find the root.

2. For each node in BFS order, find its two children by querying pairs of unprocessed nodes until their LCA is the current node.

But the code must do this efficiently within the query limit.

Thus, the final answer is to implement this approach, despite the high query count, and hope that it fits within the 4800 queries for n=10.

But I'm not sure how to implement this.

However, based on the sample input and the problem description, the correct approach seems to be:

- Find the root by querying pairs until the highest possible LCA is found.

- For each node, find its children by finding pairs in the remaining nodes whose LCA is the current node.

Thus, the code would look something like:

import sys

def main():

    n = int(input())

    size = 2**n -1

    parent = [-1]*(size +1)

    nodes = list(range(1, size+1))

    # Find root

    root = None

    for i in range(len(nodes)):

        for j in range(i+1, len(nodes)):

            u = nodes[i]

            v = nodes[j]

            print(f"? {u} {v}")

            sys.stdout.flush()

            lca = int(input())

            if root is None or lca == root:

                root = lca

    # Remove root from nodes

    nodes.remove(root)

    queue = [root]

    while queue:

        current = queue.pop(0)

        # Find two children

        children = []

        for i in range(len(nodes)):

            for j in range(i+1, len(nodes)):

                u = nodes[i]

                v = nodes[j]

                print(f"? {u} {v}")

                sys.stdout.flush()

                lca = int(input())

                if lca == current:

                    children = [u, v]

                    break

            if children:

                break

        if len(children) < 2:

            # Handle error

            pass

        else:

            # Assign children

            left, right = children

            parent[left] = current

            parent[right] = current

            # Remove from nodes

            nodes.remove(left)

            nodes.remove(right)

            # Add to queue

            queue.append(left)

            queue.append(right)

    # Output parent array

    print("! " + " ".join(map(str, parent[1:])))

But this code is incomplete and has many issues. For example, finding the root is not correct. The root is the LCA of all pairs, but this code picks the last LCA of a pair.

Thus, the code needs to be adjusted.

But given the time constraints, this is the best I can come up with.
