Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the maximum possible length of a magical subsequence. So, what's a magical sequence here? The condition is that for every i from 1 to n-1 in the subsequence, the minimum of the first i elements must be greater than or equal to the mex of the remaining elements. Oh right, and mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the collection. 

Let me start by understanding the condition. For each split point i in the subsequence, the min of the left part (a1 to ai) should be >= mex of the right part (ai+1 to an). So, the entire subsequence has to satisfy this for every possible split. 

The goal is to select as long a subsequence as possible that meets this condition. So, the approach is to find such a subsequence. 

First, let's think about some examples. The first sample input is 4 3 2 1 0. The whole sequence works because each step's min equals the mex of the right. For instance, the first split: min(4) is 4, mex of the right is 4 (since 3,2,1,0 are all present except 4). So 4 >=4. Then next split, min(4,3) is 3, mex of 2,1,0 is 3. And so on. 

In the second sample, adding an extra 3 breaks this. The split after 4,3 gives a min of 3, but the mex of 3,2,1,0 is 4. So 3 <4, which violates the condition. So they remove that 3, keeping the subsequence of 5 elements.

So, the key seems to be ensuring that each step's min(left) >= mex(right). How can we model this?

Let's think about building the subsequence. Suppose we process elements in some order and check the conditions. But since it's a subsequence, the order of the original array must be preserved. Wait, no. Wait, a subsequence is formed by deleting elements, but the order remains as per the original array. So the elements must appear in the same order as in the original array, but some can be skipped. So the problem is to select elements from the original array in their original order such that the selected elements form a magical sequence.

So, the challenge is to find the longest possible such selection. 

Let me think about possible properties of the magical sequence. Let's denote the subsequence as s_1, s_2, ..., s_k. For each i from 1 to k-1, min(s_1...s_i) >= mex(s_{i+1} ... s_k). 

Wait, mex is calculated on the suffix after i. So for each i, the mex of the suffix must be <= the minimum of the prefix up to i. 

Let's think about the mex of the suffix. The mex of the suffix can be thought of as the first missing non-negative integer in the suffix. So, for example, if the suffix contains all numbers from 0 to m-1, then mex is m. If there's a missing number, then mex is the smallest missing. 

Hmm. So for the entire sequence to be magical, every split must satisfy this condition. How can we model this?

One approach is to construct the subsequence step by step, ensuring that the conditions are met. But how?

Let me think about the structure of a magical sequence. Let's consider the entire sequence s. For the first split (i=1), the min(s_1) must be >= mex(s_2 ... s_k). For the second split (i=2), the min(s_1, s_2) must be >= mex(s_3 ... s_k). And so on. 

So, each split's mex must be <= the current min of the prefix up to that split. Also, the min of the prefix can only decrease as we add elements to it, because the min of a larger set is <= the min of a subset. So, the min of the first i elements is <= the min of the first i-1 elements. 

So, as we add elements to the prefix, the min can only stay the same or decrease. However, the mex of the suffix must be <= each of these min values. 

This suggests that the mex of the suffix must be <= the initial min(s_1), and then <= the min after each step. So the mex of each suffix is bounded by a non-increasing sequence of mins. 

Wait, but the suffix can vary. For example, after splitting at i, the suffix is s_{i+1}...s_k. The mex of this suffix must be <= the min of the first i elements. But when we split at i+1, the suffix is s_{i+2}...s_k, which is a subset of the previous suffix, so the mex could be higher. For example, if the previous suffix included 0 and 1, but the new suffix is missing 0, then mex increases. So, how can that be allowed?

But according to the condition, for split i+1, the min of the first i+1 elements (which is <= the min of first i elements) must be >= the mex of the suffix. So, in that case, the mex of the new suffix (s_{i+2}...s_k) could be higher than the mex of s_{i+1}...s_k, but the min of the prefix is now lower. So the new mex must be <= the new min. 

This seems tricky. How can we model this?

An alternative approach: perhaps the entire suffix of the subsequence must have a mex that is <= the current min of the prefix up to each split. 

Wait, perhaps the entire subsequence must have a mex for the entire suffix (from i+1 to end) that is <= the min of the first part. 

But how can we efficiently compute this for all possible splits?

Let's think of the problem in reverse. Suppose we want to build the subsequence from the end. Let's say that the mex of the entire subsequence's suffix (from some point) is m. Then, the min of the prefix up to that point must be >= m. 

Alternatively, perhaps the mex of the entire suffix (the part after the split) must not exceed the min of the prefix. 

Hmm. Let's think of the entire subsequence. Let's say that the mex of the entire suffix after the first element is m1, and m1 <= s1 (since s1 is the min of the first element). Then, the mex after the second element must be <= min(s1, s2). And so on. 

So, for each position in the subsequence, the mex of the elements after it must be <= the current min of the elements up to that position. 

But how to model this. Let's consider that the mex of the suffix after position i (elements i+1 to end) must be <= the min of the first i elements. 

This seems like a condition that must hold for all i in the subsequence. 

Now, the question is, how can we find the longest possible subsequence where this condition holds for every split. 

Let's think of the minimal possible mex for the suffix. Let's start from the end. Suppose the last element is x. Then, the suffix after the penultimate element is x. The mex of x is 0 if x is not 0. So the min of the first penultimate elements must be >= mex. 

Wait, but the mex of a single element x is 0 if x is not 0, 1 if x is 0. Wait, mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present. So for example, if the suffix is [0], mex is 1. If suffix is [1], mex is 0. 

So, for the last split (split at k-1), the mex of the last element is 0 if it's not 0, 1 if it's 0. The min of the first k-1 elements must be >= this mex. 

So for example, if the last element is 0, mex is 1. So the min of the first k-1 elements must be >= 1. 

Hmm. So, how can we structure the subsequence such that all these conditions are met?

Maybe we can model the problem by tracking for each possible mex value, the number of elements that can be included. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to greedily build the subsequence. Let's consider the following approach:

We want the mex of the suffix after each split to be as small as possible. Because the min of the prefix up to that split must be >= that mex. So, if the mex is small, the min can be larger, allowing more flexibility. 

Wait, but the mex is determined by the elements in the suffix. So perhaps including certain elements in the suffix can lead to a higher mex, which would require the min of the prefix to be higher. But the min of the prefix can be as low as possible. 

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to have the mex of each suffix as small as possible, so that the min of the prefix can be as small as possible. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the entire subsequence has the property that all elements in the suffix after position i are >= the mex required. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the mex of the entire suffix. Let's suppose that the mex of the entire suffix (after i elements) is m. Then, the min of the first i elements must be >= m. 

But how can we track this for all possible splits?

Let me consider that the entire subsequence must be such that for every i, the mex of the elements after i is <= the min of the first i elements. 

But since the subsequence is a sequence of elements from the original array in order, perhaps we can model this by building the subsequence from the end and keeping track of the required mex for each step. 

For example, let's start building the subsequence from the end. The last element can be any element. Suppose we choose the last element as x. Then, the mex of the suffix (which is just x) is mex(x) = 0 if x != 0, 1 if x ==0. Then, the min of the previous elements (the first k-1 elements) must be >= mex(x). 

But when building the subsequence from the end, perhaps we can track the required mex for the next step. Let's see:

Suppose we have a current suffix that has mex m. Then, when we add an element to the left of the suffix (i.e., the new element becomes part of the suffix for the next split), the new mex might change. But the min of the elements before this new element (which includes the elements added so far) must be >= the mex of the new suffix. 

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to formalize this. Let's denote that after adding some elements, the current state requires that the next element we add to the left must satisfy a certain condition. 

For example, when building from the end:

- Start with an empty suffix. The first element added is the last element of the subsequence. Then, the mex of the suffix (which is just this element) is m. Then, when adding a new element to the left, the suffix becomes [new_element, previous elements]. The mex of this new suffix is computed, and the min of the elements before the new_element (which is the prefix up to this new split) must be >= this new mex. 

Wait, but how do we track the prefix's min as we add elements to the left? The prefix is the elements before the current split. When building from the end, adding elements to the left would increase the prefix length. But the min of the prefix would be the min of the elements we've added to the left so far. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can track two variables for the subsequence we've built so far:

- The current mex of the suffix (elements after the split)
- The current min of the prefix (elements before the split)

Wait, but the split is between the elements we are building. For example, if we have elements s_1, s_2, ..., s_k, then each split is between s_i and s_{i+1}. So, for each split, the prefix is s_1 ... s_i and the suffix is s_{i+1} ... s_k. 

So when building from the end, perhaps we can track the mex of the current suffix and the required min for the prefix. 

Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a suffix S which has mex m. Then, the prefix up to the split (the elements before S) must have a min >= m. Now, if we add an element x to the left of S, creating a new suffix [x] + S. The mex of the new suffix would be mex(x, S). The prefix up to the new split is the elements before x, which now must have a min >= the new mex. 

But the elements before x in the subsequence would be the elements we added before x. So, perhaps this approach isn't straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem by considering that the mex of the entire suffix (all elements after the split) must be <= the min of the prefix. Let's think of the entire sequence as being built by adding elements to the left. Each time we add an element to the left, we need to ensure that the mex of the current suffix (which includes all elements after the new split) is <= the min of the new prefix (which is the min of the new element and the previous prefix's min). 

Wait, that's possible. Let's model this:

Suppose we have a current prefix min (current_min) and a current suffix mex (current_mex). When we add a new element x to the left of the prefix, the new prefix's min is min(x, current_min). The new suffix is the previous suffix (so mex remains current_mex?), but wait no. Adding x to the prefix and the suffix is the elements that were previously the suffix. So the split after the new element x would require that the mex of the suffix (previous suffix) is <= the new prefix min (min(x, current_min)). 

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows:

We start with an empty prefix and the entire subsequence as the suffix. Then, each step, we add an element to the prefix (from the original array, in reverse order?), ensuring that the mex of the suffix (the remaining elements) is <= the min of the prefix. 

But how do we manage this? Maybe we can use a greedy approach. Let's process the array from right to left, keeping track of the mex of the current suffix and the min of the prefix so far. 

Wait, here's an idea. Let's process the original array from right to left. We want to collect elements that can form a magical subsequence. For each element, we decide whether to include it in the subsequence. 

The current state includes:

- The mex of the suffix (elements that are already in the subsequence to the right of the current element)
- The minimum of the elements in the prefix (elements that are already included to the left of the current element)

Wait, perhaps we can track the mex of the current suffix and the minimum of the prefix. When adding a new element to the prefix (i.e., the left side), the new prefix's minimum is the min of the new element and the previous minimum. The mex of the new suffix (which is the current suffix) must be <= this new minimum. 

So, here's the approach:

Initialize mex_suffix = 0, min_prefix = infinity. 

Wait, but how to track mex_suffix. Wait, mex_suffix is the mex of the suffix (elements in the subsequence that are after the current split). Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, the process could be:

We start with the empty subsequence. Then, we process elements from right to left. For each element a[i], we decide whether to include it in the subsequence. 

If we include a[i], then:

- The new prefix will consist of a[i] followed by the existing prefix. 
- The mex of the suffix (the existing prefix) must be <= min of the new prefix. 

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. When adding a new element to the left, the split is after this element. The prefix is all elements up to this new element, and the suffix is all elements after. So the condition is that the mex of the suffix (the existing elements) must be <= the min of the prefix (the new element plus any elements to the left that are included). 

But how can we track this? 

Alternatively, perhaps the mex of the suffix (after the new element) is determined by the elements in the suffix. So, when adding a new element to the left, the suffix becomes the elements that were previously added. The mex of that suffix must be <= the min of the new element and the previous min. 

Wait, maybe the key is that for each new element added to the left (the current position in the array), the existing elements in the subsequence (the ones to the right of this element) form the suffix. The mex of that suffix must be <= the min of the elements that are to the left (including the current element). 

So, when adding a new element x to the left of the existing subsequence, the new prefix is x followed by the elements in the existing prefix. The min of the new prefix is min(x, existing_prefix_min). The suffix is the existing subsequence (the elements that were added before x). The mex of the suffix must be <= min(x, existing_prefix_min). 

But how do we track the mex of the existing suffix? 

This seems challenging. Let's think of the example where the existing suffix has elements [0,1,2]. The mex is 3. So when adding a new element x, the mex of the suffix (existing elements) is 3, which must be <= the min of the new prefix (x and any elements added before x). So x must be >=3, and all elements in the prefix must be >=3. 

But how can we ensure that? 

Alternatively, perhaps the mex of the existing suffix is known, and we can use that to decide if x can be added. 

Let's formalize this. Suppose that we have already processed some elements and have a current mex of the suffix (the elements that are part of the subsequence and to the right of the current position). When considering adding x (from the original array) to the left (i.e., including it in the subsequence), the condition is that the mex of the suffix (which is the existing elements) must be <= the min of the new prefix (x and the previous elements added to the left). 

Wait, but the min of the new prefix would be the min between x and the previous min of the prefix. So, for example, if previous min was m, adding x would make the new min min(x, m). The mex of the suffix (the elements already added to the right) must be <= min(x, m). 

So, the steps could be:

1. Process the array from right to left.

2. Keep track of the current min of the prefix (initially infinity, since no elements are in the prefix).

3. Keep track of the mex of the suffix (elements added to the right). 

When considering element x:

- If mex_suffix <= min(x, current_min), then we can include x in the subsequence. 

- Then, the new current_min becomes min(x, current_min). 

- The mex_suffix for the next step (when adding elements to the left of x) is the mex of the existing suffix plus x. Wait, no. Because x is added to the left of the existing suffix. So the suffix after x would be the existing suffix. So the mex_suffix remains the same as before adding x. Wait, no. Because the existing suffix is the elements that were already added to the right of x. So when we add x to the left, the suffix for x's split is the existing elements. So the mex_suffix is the mex of the existing elements (the suffix). But when adding x, x is part of the prefix, not the suffix. 

So, when we include x in the subsequence, the suffix for the split after x is the elements already in the subsequence (the ones to the right of x in the array). The mex of that suffix must be <= the min of the prefix up to x (which includes x and any elements added to the left of x in the array). 

Wait, this seems like the right approach. 

So, here's the algorithm:

Initialize:

- current_min = infinity (since the prefix is empty initially)
- mex_suffix = 0 (since the suffix is empty, mex is 0)
- count = 0 (number of elements in the subsequence)
- a set to track the elements in the suffix. Initially empty. 

But how to track mex_suffix. The mex of the suffix is the smallest non-negative integer not in the suffix. So, as we add elements to the suffix, we need to track which numbers are present and compute the mex. 

Wait, but when building the subsequence from right to left, each element added to the subsequence is part of the prefix. The suffix for the next elements (to the left) would be the elements already added. So, when adding an element x to the subsequence, x becomes part of the prefix, and the suffix is the elements already added (to the right of x in the array). So the mex_suffix is computed based on the elements already added to the suffix. 

Wait, perhaps the process is:

We start from the right end of the array. For each element, we can choose to include it in the subsequence. 

When we include x, we need to check if the mex of the current suffix (elements already in the subsequence, which are to the right of x) is <= the min of the new prefix (which is x, and any elements added to the left of x in the array). 

But how do we track the mex of the suffix (elements already in the subsequence to the right of x)?

Alternatively, when processing elements from right to left, each time we include an element x, we add it to a list (the current suffix), and compute the mex of this list. Wait, but when adding x to the left, the suffix for the next elements will be this list. 

Wait, perhaps the approach is to build the subsequence from right to left. Let's imagine that we are building the subsequence by adding elements from right to left. Each time we add an element, the mex of the elements that are already in the subsequence (to the right of the current element) must be <= the min of the elements that have been added to the left (including the current element). 

But this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to think with an example. 

Suppose the original array is [4,3,2,1,0]. Processing from right to left:

First element is 0. We can include it. The suffix is empty (since there's nothing to the right of 0). mex_suffix is 0. The prefix is [0], min is 0. Then mex_suffix must be <= min(0). So 0 <=0, which is okay. 

Next element is 1. The current suffix is [0] (elements already in the subsequence). The mex of the suffix is 1 (since 0 is present). The new prefix would include 1. The min of the new prefix is min(1, previous min (0)) = 0. So mex_suffix (1) <= 0? No. So we cannot include 1. 

Wait, but in the first sample input, the entire array is included. So this approach is not working. 

Hmm. So perhaps the approach of processing right to left is not the right way. 

Alternative idea: For a subsequence to be magical, the mex of the suffix after each split must be <= the min of the prefix up to that split. 

If we can arrange the subsequence in such a way that each element added to the prefix is >= the mex of the suffix, and the mex of the suffix is as small as possible. 

Another approach: Let's consider that the mex of the entire suffix (after the first element) must be <= the first element. The mex of the suffix after the second element must be <= the min of the first two elements. And so on. 

So, perhaps the optimal subsequence is such that each element is as small as possible to allow the mex of the suffix to be as small as possible. 

Wait, but how? 

Alternatively, perhaps the mex of the entire suffix (after i elements) must be <= the minimum of the first i elements. So for the entire sequence, the minimum of the first i elements must be >= the mex of the suffix. 

This suggests that the mex of the suffix cannot exceed the minimum of the first i elements. So, the mex of the suffix can be up to the minimum of the first i elements. 

But how can we model this for the entire sequence?

Let me think of the mex of the entire subsequence. For example, the mex of the entire subsequence is the smallest non-negative integer not present. If the entire subsequence has mex m, then for the first split (i=1), the mex of the suffix (elements 2 to k) must be <= the first element. 

But I'm not sure. 

Let's think about the mex of the entire suffix for each split. For each i, the suffix is s_{i+1} to s_k. The mex of that suffix must be <= min(s_1 ... s_i). 

So, for all possible splits, the mex of the suffix must be <= the min of the prefix. 

What if the entire subsequence is sorted in non-increasing order? For example, the first sample input is [4,3,2,1,0]. Each split's min is 4,3,2,1,0, and the mex of the suffix is 4,3,2,1,0. So it works. 

Another example: [3,3,2,1,0]. The first split has min 3, mex of the suffix [3,2,1,0] is 4. So 3 <4, which is invalid. So this sequence is not magical. 

So, a sorted sequence in non-increasing order may be magical if the mex of each suffix equals the min of the prefix. 

But how to handle cases where elements are not in order?

Perhaps the optimal subsequence is a non-increasing sequence where the mex of each suffix is exactly the min of the prefix. 

But how to construct that? 

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible length is achieved by a subsequence where the elements are non-increasing, and the mex of the suffix is exactly the min of the prefix. 

In that case, the approach would be to select a non-increasing subsequence and check if the mex of the suffixes equals the min of the prefixes. 

But how to compute this efficiently. 

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible length is the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence where each element is >= the mex of the remaining elements. 

But this seems similar to the problem's condition. 

But even that may not be easy to compute. 

Alternatively, let's think of the mex of the entire subsequence. Let the mex of the entire subsequence be m. Then, for the first split (i=1), the mex of the suffix (elements 2 to k) must be <= the first element. 

But the mex of the entire subsequence is m, which implies that all elements 0 to m-1 are present. So, if the first element is >= m, then the mex of the suffix (elements 2 to k) could be m. 

But I'm not sure. 

Another approach: For a magical subsequence, the mex of the entire subsequence (as a whole) can be any value. But the condition requires that for each split, the mex of the suffix is <= the min of the prefix. 

Perhaps the mex of the entire subsequence (as a whole) is the mex of the entire sequence. Then, for each split, the mex of the suffix is <= the min of the prefix. 

But this doesn't directly help. 

Wait, perhaps the mex of the suffix can't be larger than the mex of the entire subsequence. Because the suffix is a subset of the entire sequence. For example, the mex of the entire sequence is m. The mex of a suffix can't be larger than m, because if m is not present in the entire sequence, it's not present in the suffix. 

Wait, no. The mex of the suffix could be higher than the mex of the entire sequence. For example, if the entire sequence is [1,2], mex is 0. The suffix [2] has mex 0. But if the entire sequence is [0,2], mex is 1. The suffix [2] has mex 0. 

Wait, no. If the entire sequence is [0,2], mex is 1. The suffix [2] has mex 0. 

So the mex of a suffix can be less than or equal to the mex of the entire sequence. 

But this doesn't directly help. 

Let's think differently. Suppose we have a subsequence S. For it to be magical, each split must satisfy the condition. Let's see if there's a way to model the mex of the suffix for each split. 

Suppose that for each split i (1-based), the mex of the suffix S_{i+1}, ..., S_k is m_i. Then, for all i, m_i <= min(S_1, ..., S_i). 

The mex of each suffix must form a sequence where each m_i is <= the min of the first i elements, which is a non-increasing sequence. 

But how to construct such a sequence. 

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal subsequence is such that the mex of the entire sequence is m, and the min of the entire sequence is >= m. 

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the first sample, the entire sequence's mex is 5, but the min is 0. 0 <5. So that's not the case. 

Hmm. 

Another idea: the mex of the entire suffix after the first element must be <= the first element. 

Let me consider the first element as x. Then, the mex of the suffix (S_2 to S_k) must be <= x. So, all elements in the suffix must include all numbers from 0 to x-1. Because if any number in 0 to x-1 is missing, then the mex would be that missing number, which is <=x-1, which is <=x. 

Wait, no. The mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present. So, if the suffix is missing 0, then mex is 0, which is <=x. If x is >=0, this holds. So, even if the suffix is missing some numbers in 0 to x-1, mex is the first missing one. 

So, the mex of the suffix can be <=x. For example, if the suffix contains x+1 but not 0, mex is 0. 

So, the mex of the suffix after the first element is <=x. So, the first element must be >= the mex of the suffix. 

But how does that help? 

Let's think of the first element as x. The mex of the suffix must be <=x. Then, the second element in the subsequence is y. The mex of the suffix after the second element (elements 3 to k) must be <= min(x,y). 

But y can be >=x (since the sequence is a subsequence, not necessarily sorted). 

But if x is the first element, then the min of the first two elements is min(x,y), which is <=x. So, the mex of the suffix after the second element must be <= min(x,y). 

But how can this be arranged?

This seems like a problem that requires dynamic programming. For each position in the array and for some state variables (current mex, current min), track the maximum possible subsequence length. 

But the constraints for n up to 2e5 make this approach infeasible. 

Alternative approach: Find that the maximum possible length is either n (if the entire array is magical) or find a way to greedily select elements that form a magical sequence. 

But how? 

Looking back at the sample inputs, the first sample's entire array is magical, so the answer is 5. The second sample's entire array isn't, but by removing one element, the answer becomes 5. 

In the third sample, the input is [2,0,1,2]. The maximum length is 3. For example, the subsequence [2,0,2] is not valid. Maybe [2,1,2] is possible. Wait, but the sample output is 3. Let's see: 

Original array is 2,0,1,2. 

If the subsequence is [2,0,1], then:

- Split after 2: min(2) >= mex(0,1). mex is 2. 2 >=2. 

- Split after 0: min(2,0) =0. mex(1) is 0. 0 >=0. 

So condition holds. So the length is 3. 

Another possible subsequence is [2,0,2]. 

Split after 2: min(2) >= mex(0,2). mex of [0,2] is 1. 2 >=1. 

Split after 0: min(2,0)=0 >= mex(2). mex is 0. 0 >=0. 

So this is valid, but the length is 3. So the answer is 3. 

So in this case, the maximum is 3. 

So how to find such a subsequence?

Another observation: the mex of the suffix after any split must be <= the min of the prefix up to that split. 

This suggests that the mex of the suffix can't be higher than any of the elements in the prefix. 

But the mex is determined by the elements in the suffix. So, the elements in the suffix must contain all numbers from 0 up to mex-1, but mex is the smallest missing. 

Wait, no. The mex is the smallest non-negative integer missing from the suffix. So, for the mex to be m, the suffix must contain all numbers from 0 to m-1, and not contain m. 

So, if the mex of the suffix is m, then the suffix contains 0..m-1 and doesn't contain m. 

But the prefix's min must be >=m. 

So, for each split, the min of the prefix must be >=m, where m is the mex of the suffix. 

But the prefix's elements can be anything as long as their min is >=m. 

So, the key is to choose elements such that for each split, the suffix has a mex m that is <= the min of the prefix. 

But how to model this. 

Perhaps the maximum length is achieved by including all possible elements, but whenever a new element is added that causes the mex of the suffix to exceed the min of the prefix, we have to remove that element. 

Alternatively, we can think of the problem as building the subsequence in a way that ensures that every time we add an element to the left, the mex of the current suffix is <= the new min of the prefix. 

Let me try to model this with a greedy approach. 

Suppose we process elements from left to right. For each element, we decide whether to include it in the subsequence. 

But how to track the necessary conditions. 

Alternatively, process from right to left, and track the mex of the current suffix and the current min of the prefix. 

Here's a possible approach:

We process elements from right to left. We maintain a set of elements in the suffix (elements already included in the subsequence). We also track the mex of this suffix. 

Initially, the suffix is empty, mex_suffix is 0, and current_min (the minimum of the prefix) is infinity. 

As we process each element a[i], we can decide to include it in the subsequence. 

Including a[i] would add it to the prefix. The new prefix's min is min(a[i], current_min). 

The condition for including a[i] is that mex_suffix <= new_min. 

If we include a[i], then:

- Add a[i] to the prefix (update current_min)
- The suffix remains the elements already in the subsequence (to the right of a[i])
- The mex_suffix remains the same (since the suffix is the same as before)

But wait, if we include a[i], then the suffix for elements to the left of a[i] (processed next) would be the existing suffix plus a[i]. So, including a[i] would change the suffix for the next elements. 

Wait, no. When processing elements from right to left, including a[i] adds it to the subsequence. The elements to the left of a[i] (earlier in processing) would have to consider the suffix as the elements already added (which are to the right of the current element). 

So, when processing element a[i], the elements already in the subsequence are to the right of a[i]. So, when we include a[i], the suffix for the next elements (to the left of a[i]) will include a[i] and the elements already in the subsequence. 

Wait, no. Because when processing elements from right to left, the elements already added are to the right (i.e., have higher indices). When we process a[i], which is at position i, the elements already in the subsequence are from positions >i. So, including a[i] in the subsequence would mean that in the subsequence, a[i] comes before those elements. 

Thus, when we process a[i], the elements already in the subsequence (to the right) form the suffix for the split after a[i]. 

So, when considering whether to include a[i], the mex of the suffix (the elements already in the subsequence) must be <= the min of the prefix (a[i] and any elements added to the left of a[i] in the future). 

But the min of the prefix is a[i] and the elements added after (left of a[i], which are processed later). So this approach might not work. 

Hmm. This seems complicated. 

Alternative idea: Since the mex of the suffix must be <= the current min of the prefix, perhaps the mex of the suffix is the key constraint. 

To maximize the length, we want to include as many elements as possible. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to include all elements except those that would cause the mex of the suffix to exceed the min of the prefix. 

But how to determine which elements to exclude. 

Wait, perhaps the critical factor is the mex of the suffix. For each element added to the left, the mex of the suffix must not exceed the current min of the prefix. 

Thus, when processing from right to left, we can track the mex of the current suffix. 

Here's a possible algorithm:

1. Initialize a frequency array or a set to track the elements in the current suffix. 
2. Initialize mex_suffix to 0. 
3. Initialize current_min to infinity. 
4. Initialize the count of elements in the subsequence to 0. 

Processing elements from right to left:

For each element x in a, from right to left:

a. Check if mex_suffix <= current_min. 

But wait, current_min is the minimum of the elements in the prefix (elements added to the left of x). Wait, no. Because current_min is the minimum of the elements added to the prefix (which are elements processed so far, i.e., to the right of the current element). 

Wait, when processing from right to left, each element is considered for inclusion in the subsequence. Once added, it becomes part of the prefix (elements to the left of the existing suffix). 

So, the current_min is the minimum of the elements already included in the prefix. 

So, for element x (current element), including it would set the new prefix min to min(x, current_min). 

But before including x, the condition is that mex_suffix (the mex of the current suffix) must be <= x and <= current_min (the current_min is the previous prefix's min). Because including x would create a new prefix whose min is min(x, current_min), and the mex of the suffix (existing suffix) must be <= this new min. 

Wait, but current_min is the min of the elements already added to the prefix (to the left of the current element). So, when we include x, the new prefix's min is the minimum between x and the current_min. 

So, the condition is: mex_suffix <= min(x, current_min). 

But how can we know the current_min before processing x? Because current_min is the min of the elements already added to the prefix (which are elements to the right of x, which have been processed already). 

Wait, no. Processing from right to left, the elements are processed in order of decreasing index. For example, the first element processed is a[n-1], then a[n-2], etc. 

When we include a[i], it's added to the prefix, and the current_min is updated to min(a[i], current_min). 

So, the algorithm would be:

Initialize:

count = 0

current_min = infinity

mex_suffix = 0

elements_in_suffix = a frequency array or dictionary to track which elements are present in the suffix.

elements_in_suffix starts empty. 

Processing elements from right to left:

for x in reversed(a):

    if mex_suffix <= min(x, current_min):

        include x in the subsequence. 

        count +=1

        current_min = min(x, current_min)

        # since x is added to the prefix, the suffix for the next elements (processed to the left) is the current suffix (elements_in_suffix)

    else:

        # try adding x to the suffix (i.e., not include it in the subsequence)

        # but wait, no. If we don't include x in the subsequence, then x is not part of the subsequence. So, the suffix for elements to the left remains as before. 

        # So, if x is not included, it's as if it was skipped. 

        # So, what's the effect of not including x?

        # The suffix remains the same. 

        # So, we can choose to include x in the suffix (but the suffix is not part of the subsequence)

        # Wait, no. The suffix is the elements in the subsequence that are to the right of the current split. 

        # So, if x is not included in the subsequence, it's not part of the suffix. 

        # So, the suffix remains as before. 

        # So, in this case, we do nothing. 

So, the decision is: include x in the subsequence (prefix) only if mex_suffix <= min(x, current_min). 

But how to compute mex_suffix. 

Wait, mex_suffix is the mex of the elements in the current suffix. The suffix is the elements in the subsequence that are to the right of the current split. 

Initially, the suffix is empty. mex_suffix is 0. 

When we include x in the prefix, the suffix for the next elements (processed to the left) remains the same. 

But when we don't include x, x is not part of the subsequence, so it's not part of the suffix. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let's clarify:

When processing x (from right to left), if we decide to include it in the subsequence, then:

- x is added to the prefix. The current_min is updated to min(x, current_min).

- The suffix remains the elements that were already in the suffix (elements that were processed and included to the right of x).

If we decide not to include x in the subsequence, then x is not part of the subsequence, and the suffix remains as before. 

But wait, in this model, the suffix is the elements already added to the subsequence (to the right of the current element). So, when we process x (element i), the elements already in the suffix are the ones in the subsequence that are to the right of x (i.e., have higher indices). 

Including x in the subsequence adds it to the prefix. The suffix for the split after x is the elements already in the suffix. 

So, the mex_suffix is computed based on the elements in the suffix (the elements already in the subsequence to the right of x). 

But how do we track mex_suffix? 

To compute mex_suffix, we need to track the elements in the suffix. 

But when processing from right to left, each time we include an element, it's added to the prefix, and the suffix remains the same. 

Wait, no. When we include x, it's added to the prefix. The elements in the suffix are the elements already included in the subsequence to the right of x. 

So, for example, the first element processed is a[n-1]. If we include it, then the suffix is empty (nothing to the right). The mex_suffix is 0. 

The next element processed is a[n-2]. If we include it, then the suffix is [a[n-1]] if it was included. 

Wait, this suggests that the elements in the suffix are those that were included in the subsequence and are to the right of the current element. 

So, to track the elements in the suffix, we need to know which elements are included in the subsequence to the right of the current element. 

But how to track this. 

This seems complex. 

Alternative approach: For each element x, the decision to include it in the subsequence depends on the mex of the suffix (elements already included to the right) and the current min of the prefix. 

But how can we compute the mex of the suffix efficiently? 

Let me think of using a frequency array or a set to track the elements in the suffix. For example, as we process elements from right to left, when we include an element x in the subsequence, it is part of the prefix. The elements in the suffix are those that have already been included in the subsequence and are to the right of x. So, when processing x, the elements in the suffix are those that have been included so far (processed after x). 

Wait, when processing x (element at position i), any elements to the right (processed before x) that have been included in the subsequence are part of the suffix. 

So, the suffix is the collection of elements already included in the subsequence that are to the right of x. 

Thus, when we process x, the elements in the suffix are those that have been included in the subsequence so far (because we're processing from right to left). 

So, the mex_suffix is the mex of these elements. 

So, the steps would be:

- Process elements from right to left.

- For each x:

   - Check if the mex of the elements in the suffix (so far) is <= min(x, current_min). 

   - If yes, include x in the subsequence. Update current_min to min(x, current_min). 

   - Else, do not include x. 

But how to compute the mex of the suffix. 

Computing mex efficiently is key. 

To track the mex of a dynamic set, we can maintain a frequency array and track the current mex. 

Since the elements can be up to 1e9, a frequency array isn't feasible. So we need a smarter way. 

But mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. 

So, we can maintain a set (like a hash set) and keep track of the current mex. 

Initially, mex_suffix is 0. 

When we add an element to the suffix (wait, no, elements are added to the prefix. The suffix is the elements already in the subsequence to the right. So, when we include x in the subsequence, x is added to the prefix. The suffix remains the elements already in the subsequence (to the right of x). So, the elements in the suffix are those that have been included in the subsequence and processed before x. 

So, when processing x, the elements in the suffix are the ones already included in the subsequence (those processed before x, which are to the right of x in the array). 

Therefore, when processing x, the suffix is the elements in the subsequence that are to the right of x. 

So, when we include x in the subsequence, x is added to the prefix. The suffix for the next elements (to the left of x) will include the current suffix (elements already in the subsequence to the right) and x is not part of the suffix. 

Wait, no. When processing x (position i), the suffix for x is the elements already included in the subsequence to the right (processed before x). If we include x, then when processing the next element (i-1), the suffix for i-1 will be the elements already included in the subsequence to the right of i-1. So, x is to the right of i-1 and if included, is part of the suffix for i-1. 

So, including x in the subsequence adds it to the suffix for elements processed after x (i.e., to the left of x). 

So, when processing x, the elements in the suffix are those that have been included in the subsequence so far (processed before x). 

So, when we include x in the subsequence, it's added to the prefix. The elements to the left of x (processed after x) will have a suffix that includes x. 

So, the algorithm would be:

Initialize:

- a frequency set (present) to track elements in the suffix.

- mex_suffix = 0.

- current_min = infinity.

- count =0.

Process elements from right to left:

For x in reversed(a):

    # the current suffix is 'present' set.

    # compute mex_suffix.

    # check if mex_suffix <= min(x, current_min).

    if mex_suffix <= min(x, current_min):

        count +=1

        current_min = min(x, current_min)

        # x is added to the prefix, so the suffix for the next elements will include x.

        # Wait, no. If x is added to the prefix, the elements to the left of x (processed next) will have their suffix as the current suffix plus x?

        # No, the elements to the left of x (processed next) will have their suffix as the elements already in the subsequence (those processed before x). 

        # So, x is part of the prefix for elements processed after x (to the left of x). 

        # The suffix for elements processed after x (to the left) is the elements in the present set plus x?

        # No. When we include x in the subsequence, it's part of the prefix. The suffix for elements processed after x (to the left) is the elements that are in the subsequence and to the right of the current element. 

        # Since x is processed now (right to left), and we include it, the next elements (to the left of x) will have x to their right. 

        # So, x is part of the suffix for elements processed after x. 

        # Therefore, when we include x in the subsequence, we need to add x to the present set (the suffix for the next elements).

        present.add(x)

        # update mex_suffix.

        # mex_suffix is the smallest non-negative integer not in present.

        while mex_suffix in present:

            mex_suffix +=1

    else:

        # do not include x in the subsequence.

        # the present set remains the same.

        pass

This seems like a possible approach. 

So, the algorithm is:

1. Process the array from right to left.

2. For each element x:

   a. Check if the current mex of the present set (elements in the suffix) is <= the minimum between x and current_min.

   b. If yes, include x in the subsequence. Update current_min to min(x, current_min), add x to the present set, and update mex_suffix.

   c. Else, skip x.

This way, we ensure that for each element added to the prefix, the mex of the suffix (elements already in the present set) is <= the new current_min.

This approach builds the subsequence in a way that satisfies the condition for each split. 

Let's test this algorithm against the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

5

4 3 2 1 0

Processing from right to left:

Elements: 0,1,2,3,4.

Initial present is empty, mex_suffix is 0, current_min is infinity.

Process 0:

mex_suffix (0) <= min(0, infinity) => 0 <=0 → yes.

Include 0. count=1. current_min=0.

Add 0 to present. mex_suffix increments to 1.

Process 1:

mex_suffix is 1. Check if 1 <= min(1, 0) → 1 <=0 → no. So, skip.

Process 2:

mex_suffix is 1. Check if 1 <= min(2, 0) → 1 <=0 → no. Skip.

Process 3:

mex_suffix is 1. Check if 1 <= min(3,0) → 1 <=0 → no. Skip.

Process 4:

mex_suffix is 1. Check if 1 <= min(4,0) → 1 <=0 → no. Skip.

Final count is 1. But this contradicts the sample output of 5. 

Wait, this can't be right. There's clearly a problem with this approach. 

What's wrong here?

Ah, because when processing from right to left, the first element processed is 0, which is added to the present set. The next element is 1. The mex_suffix is 1 (since present has 0). The current_min is 0. So, 1 <= min(1, 0) → 1 <=0 → false. So 1 is not added. But in the sample input, 1 is part of the subsequence. 

So this algorithm gives the wrong result. 

Hmm. This suggests that the approach is incorrect. 

What's the issue? The algorithm is processing elements from right to left and adding them to the prefix only if the mex of the current suffix is <= the min of the new prefix (x and current_min). 

But in the first sample, the entire array is valid. So when processing from right to left, all elements should be added. But according to the algorithm, only 0 is added. 

Clearly, this approach is incorrect. 

So what's the mistake?

The algorithm is considering the suffix for the split after x as the elements already added to the present set. But when processing from right to left, adding x to the prefix makes x part of the prefix, and the suffix for the next elements (to the left) is the present set (which includes x). 

Wait, no. Because in the algorithm, when we add x to the present set, the present set represents the elements in the suffix for the next elements. 

But the suffix for the split after x is the elements already added to the present set. 

Wait, no. The present set is supposed to track the elements in the suffix. When we add x to the present set, x becomes part of the suffix for the next elements (to the left). 

But when x is added to the subsequence, it's part of the prefix. The suffix for the next elements (to the left of x) would be the elements added after x (to the right), which is the present set (elements already added). 

But in the algorithm, when x is added to the present set, it's part of the suffix for the next elements. 

This is the mistake. 

When x is added to the subsequence, it's part of the prefix. The suffix for the next elements (to the left) are the elements that are to the right of x in the array. 

So, when processing x (element i), including x in the subsequence adds it to the prefix. The suffix for elements to the left (i-1) are the elements in the present set. 

But the present set should represent the elements in the suffix (elements to the right of the current element). 

Thus, when processing x (element i), the elements in the present set are those that have been added to the subsequence and are to the right of i (i.e., have higher indices). 

When we include x in the subsequence, x is added to the prefix. The elements to the left of x (i-1) will have their suffix as the present set. 

But x is not part of the suffix for the elements to the left. 

So, the present set should not include x when processing elements to the left. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach of adding x to the present set is incorrect. 

So, the present set should not include x when x is added to the prefix. 

This is a critical mistake in the algorithm. 

So, the correct approach is:

When processing x (element i):

- If we include x in the subsequence, it's added to the prefix. The suffix for elements to the left (i-1) is the elements already added to the subsequence (present set). 

- So, x is not part of the suffix for elements to the left. 

Thus, the present set should remain as it was before including x. 

Therefore, the algorithm should not add x to the present set when including it in the prefix. 

But then, how to track the mex of the suffix?

Ah, here's the correct approach:

The present set tracks the elements in the suffix (elements already added to the subsequence and to the right of the current element). 

When processing x (element i):

- The elements in the suffix (present set) are those that have been added to the subsequence and are to the right of i. 

- If we include x in the subsequence, x is added to the prefix, and the suffix for elements to the left of i is still the present set. 

- Thus, the present set does not change when including x. 

But how is mex_suffix computed then? 

Because the present set does not change, mex_suffix remains the same. 

But this seems to contradict the sample input. 

Let me re-examine the first sample input with this corrected approach. 

Sample Input 1:

5

4 3 2 1 0

Processing elements from right to left (0,1,2,3,4):

Initialize present set is empty. mex_suffix is 0. current_min is infinity. count=0.

Process 0:

Check if mex_suffix (0) <= min(0, infinity) → 0 <=0 → yes.

Include x=0. count=1. current_min=0.

Do not add 0 to present set. present set remains empty. mex_suffix remains 0.

Process 1:

mex_suffix is 0. Check 0 <= min(1, 0) → 0 <=0 → yes.

Include x=1. count=2. current_min=0.

Do not add 1 to present set. present set remains empty. mex_suffix remains 0.

Process 2:

mex_suffix is 0. Check 0 <= min(2, 0) → yes.

Include x=2. count=3. current_min=0.

present set remains empty. mex_suffix remains 0.

Process 3:

mex_suffix is 0. Check 0 <=0 → yes.

Include x=3. count=4. current_min=0.

present set remains empty. mex_suffix remains 0.

Process 4:

mex_suffix is 0. Check 0 <=0 → yes.

Include x=4. count=5. current_min=0.

present set remains empty. mex_suffix remains 0.

Thus, the count is 5, which matches the sample output. 

But wait, how? Because the present set is empty, mex_suffix is 0. 

But when including x=0 in the subsequence, the suffix for the next elements (1,2,3,4) is empty. So, mex_suffix is 0. 

Yes. For example, when processing x=1, the suffix is empty (present set is empty). So mex_suffix is 0. 

The condition is 0 <= min(1, current_min). current_min is 0. So yes. 

Similarly for all other elements. 

So, this approach works for the first sample. 

Let's check the second sample input:

Sample Input 2:

6

4 3 3 2 1 0

Processing from right to left: 0,1,2,3,3,4.

present is empty, mex_suffix=0, current_min=infinity.

Process 0:

mex_suffix=0 <=0 → yes. count=1. current_min=0.

present remains empty.

Process 1:

mex_suffix=0 <=0 → yes. count=2. current_min=0.

Process 2:

mex_suffix=0 <=0 → yes. count=3. current_min=0.

Process 3:

mex_suffix=0 <=0 → yes. count=4. current_min=0.

Process 3:

mex_suffix=0 <=0 → yes. count=5. current_min=0.

Process 4:

mex_suffix=0 <=0 → yes. count=6. current_min=0.

But the sample output is 5. 

Wait, this suggests that the algorithm would include all 6 elements, but the sample output is 5. 

But the sample input is 6 elements, and the correct output is 5. 

So there's a discrepancy. 

Ah, in the second sample input, the entire array is [4,3,3,2,1,0]. The sample output is 5. The problem is that the entire array isn't magical. For example, the split after the first element (4) has mex of the suffix (3,3,2,1,0) which is 4. The min of the first element is 4 >=4. 

Split after second element (3) has mex of the suffix (3,2,1,0) is 4. The min of first two elements is 3. 3 <4, which violates the condition. 

Thus, the entire array is not magical, and the maximum length is 5. 

But according to the algorithm, when processing from right to left, all elements are included. 

So why is that?

Because the algorithm's condition checks for each element whether the mex of the current suffix (elements already added to the right) is <= min(x, current_min). 

In the second sample, when processing the two 3's:

The first 3 (element 3 in the original array) is processed after 0,1,2,3. 

When processing the first 3 (element index 3, value 3):

mex_suffix is 0 (present set is empty). min(3, current_min (0)) is 0. 0 <=0 → yes. Include. current_min becomes 0. present set remains empty. 

Then processing the next 3 (element index 2, value 3):

mex_suffix is 0. min(3, 0) is 0. 0 <=0 → include. current_min remains 0. 

Then processing 4 (element index 0, value4):

mex_suffix 0 <=0 → include. 

Thus, the algorithm includes all 6 elements. But the actual maximum is 5. 

So the algorithm is incorrect. 

What's the problem here?

The algorithm's condition checks that the mex of the suffix (elements to the right) is <= the min of x and current_min. 

But in the actual subsequence, the condition must hold for all splits. 

Including all 6 elements in the second sample would result in a subsequence where one of the splits violates the condition. 

So the algorithm's approach of processing from right to left and including elements whenever mex_suffix <= min(x, current_min) is not sufficient. 

This indicates that the algorithm is incorrect. 

Hmm. 

So, what's the problem with the algorithm?

The algorithm assumes that if each element x is included with the condition that the mex of the current suffix (elements to the right) is <= min(x, current_min), then the entire subsequence will be magical. 

But this is not the case. Because the splits in the middle of the subsequence may violate the condition. 

For example, in the second sample input, the algorithm includes all 6 elements. But when the subsequence is [4,3,3,2,1,0], the split after the second element (3) has min(4,3) =3. The mex of the suffix (3,2,1,0) is 4. So 3<4, which violates the condition. 

But according to the algorithm, when processing the second 3 (element index 2), mex_suffix is 0 (present set is empty). The condition is 0 <= min(3, current_min=0) → yes. 

But the actual split in the subsequence has a different suffix. 

The problem is that the algorithm is not tracking the mex of the correct suffix for each split. 

When processing elements from right to left, the present set tracks the elements in the suffix (elements to the right of the current element). But when we include an element x, it's added to the prefix. The suffix for splits involving x is the elements to the right of x in the array. But for splits involving elements to the left of x, the suffix includes x and other elements to the right. 

But the algorithm's approach of keeping the present set empty in the second sample leads to including all elements. 

But the actual mex of the suffix after the second element (3) in the subsequence is 4, which violates the condition. 

So, the algorithm's approach is incorrect. 

This suggests that the mex of the suffix is not being tracked correctly. 

Thus, the problem requires a different approach. 

Alternative idea: For a subsequence to be magical, the mex of each suffix (after each split) must be <= the min of the corresponding prefix. 

The mex of each suffix depends on the elements in that suffix. Thus, the entire subsequence must be constructed such that, for every split, the mex of the suffix is <= the min of the prefix. 

But how to ensure this for all splits. 

Perhaps the key insight is that the entire subsequence must be such that the mex of each suffix is equal to the minimum of the prefix. 

This is because the minimum of the prefix can't be smaller than the mex of the suffix. 

For example, in the first sample, the mex of each suffix is exactly the min of the prefix. 

In the second sample, when the subsequence is [4,3,2,1,0], each split has mex equal to the min. 

Thus, perhaps the maximum length is achieved when the subsequence is sorted in non-increasing order and for each split, the mex of the suffix equals the min of the prefix. 

But how to find such a subsequence. 

Let me think of the following approach:

We need to select a subsequence S such that for each position i in S:

1. S is sorted in non-increasing order.

2. The mex of S[i+1...k] is equal to S[i]. 

Wait, but this is not necessarily true. For example, the first sample has mex of the suffix equal to the min of the prefix. 

Alternatively, perhaps the mex of the suffix must be exactly the min of the prefix. 

But how to model this. 

Let me try to find a pattern. 

For the first sample, each split's mex is exactly the min of the prefix. 

For example, split after 4: mex is 4, min is 4.

Split after 3: mex is 3, min is 3.

Etc. 

So the mex of the suffix is exactly the min of the prefix. 

In the second sample, when the subsequence is [4,3,2,1,0], the same holds. 

Thus, perhaps the optimal subsequence is such that each suffix's mex is exactly equal to the min of the prefix. 

If this is the case, then the subsequence must be a non-increasing sequence where each element is exactly one less than the previous. 

But the first sample is 4,3,2,1,0. Each element is one less than the previous. 

So, perhaps the maximum possible length is the longest possible sequence of consecutive integers in non-increasing order. 

But how to find such a sequence in the array. 

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible length is the length of the longest possible sequence where each element is the mex of the suffix after it. 

But I'm not sure. 

Another idea: the mex of the suffix after each split is the min of the prefix. 

The mex of the suffix after i elements is the min of the first i elements. 

So, for the entire subsequence S:

min(S_1, ..., S_i) = mex(S_{i+1}, ..., S_k) for all i=1..k-1. 

In this case, the sequence S must be such that the mex of each suffix S_{i+1}..k is equal to the min of the first i elements. 

This seems like a very specific condition. 

How can we construct such a sequence?

For example, let's consider a sequence S where S is a non-increasing sequence of consecutive integers starting from m. 

For example, m, m-1, m-2, ..., 0. 

In this case, the mex of the suffix after i elements is m-i. 

The min of the first i elements is m. So this doesn't work. 

Wait, no. The min of the first i elements is m - (i-1). 

Hmm, perhaps not. 

Alternatively, let's think of the sequence S as k, k-1, ..., 0. 

For each split i (1 <=i <=k-1):

- The first i elements are k, k-1, ..., k-i+1. The min is k-i+1.

- The suffix elements are k-i, ..., 0. The mex is k-i+1. 

Yes. Because the suffix contains 0 to k-i, so the mex is k-i+1. 

So, this sequence satisfies the condition. 

Thus, the maximum possible length is the maximum possible m+1 where the array contains all integers from 0 to m. 

But this is not correct, as the first sample has elements 4,3,2,1,0, which includes all integers down to 0. The mex of the suffix after each split is 4,3,2,1,0, which matches the min of the prefix. 

But the elements don't have to be consecutive. For example, the sequence [5,3,2,1,0] would have min(5) =5, mex of suffix [3,2,1,0] is 4, which is <=5. 

But the condition requires that 5 >=4. 

But then the next split: min(5,3) =3. Mex of suffix [2,1,0] is 3. 3 >=3. 

Next split: min(5,3,2) =2. Mex of suffix [1,0] is 2. 

And so on. 

Thus, the sequence [5,3,2,1,0] would also be valid. 

So the elements don't have to be consecutive. 

Thus, the key is to have a non-increasing sequence where each element is >= the mex of the suffix after it. 

But how to find the longest such sequence. 

This suggests that the maximum possible length is the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence where each element is >= the mex of the suffix after it. 

But how to compute this. 

Perhaps the mex of the suffix after the i-th element is the number of distinct elements in the suffix. 

No, that's not the case. For example, mex of [3,2,1,0] is 4. 

Hmm. 

Alternative approach: For the subsequence to be magical, each element must be >= the mex of the elements that come after it. 

Thus, for each element x in the subsequence, x >= mex of the elements after x. 

Moreover, the elements must be chosen in such a way that this condition holds for all elements. 

So, the problem reduces to selecting a subsequence where each element is >= the mex of the elements that come after it. 

This is a crucial insight. 

Because, for the subsequence S, the min of the first i elements is >= mex of the suffix after i elements. But the min of the first i elements is <= each element in the first i elements. 

So, if each element in the subsequence is >= the mex of the elements that come after it, then the min of the first i elements (which is <= each element in the first i) will be >= mex of the suffix. 

Thus, this condition would ensure that the entire sequence is magical. 

So, the problem reduces to finding the longest possible subsequence where each element is >= the mex of the elements that come after it. 

This is a key insight. 

Now, the question is, how to find such a subsequence. 

The mex of the elements that come after x is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the elements after x. 

Thus, for each x in the subsequence, x must be >= mex of the elements after x. 

We can model this by processing the array from right to left and greedily adding elements that satisfy x >= current_mex. 

The current_mex is the mex of the elements already in the subsequence. 

This approach is similar to building a sequence by processing from right to left, and maintaining the mex of the current subsequence. 

Here's the algorithm:

Initialize current_mex =0. 

Initialize a set present to track the elements in the subsequence. 

count =0.

Process elements from right to left:

for x in reversed(a):

    if x >= current_mex and x not in present:

        # add x to the subsequence.

        present.add(x)

        count +=1

        # update current_mex.

        while current_mex in present:

            current_mex +=1

Thus, the algorithm greedily adds elements that are >= the current_mex and not already present. 

This way, the mex of the elements after x (those already in the subsequence) is current_mex. 

But x >= current_mex. 

This ensures that each element in the subsequence satisfies x >= mex of the elements after it. 

Thus, this subsequence is magical. 

But is this the longest possible?

Let's test this algorithm on the sample inputs. 

Sample Input 1:

5

4 3 2 1 0.

Processing from right to left: 0,1,2,3,4.

current_mex starts at 0.

0 >=0 and not in present → add to present. count=1. current_mex becomes 1.

1 >=1 and not in present → add. count=2. current_mex becomes 2.

2 >=2 and not in present → add. count=3. current_mex becomes3.

3 >=3 → add. count=4. current_mex becomes4.

4 >=4 → add. count=5. current_mex becomes5.

Thus, the count is 5. Correct.

Sample Input 2:

6

4 3 3 2 1 0.

Processing from right to left: 0,1,2,3,3,4.

0 >=0 → add. present={0}, mex=1.

1 >=1 → add. present={0,1}, mex=2.

2 >=2 → add. present={0,1,2}, mex=3.

3 >=3 → add. present={0,1,2,3}, mex=4.

3 is already in present → skip.

4 >=4 → add. present={0,1,2,3,4}, mex=5.

Thus, count=5. Which matches the sample output. 

Sample Input 3:

4

2 0 1 2.

Processing from right to left: 2,1,0,2.

current_mex=0.

2 >=0 → add. present={2}, mex=0 (since 0 is not present). 

Wait, current_mex is initialized to 0. 

Processing 2 (rightmost element):

x=2 >=0 → add to present. present={2}.

Now, check if 0 is in present. No. So mex remains 0. 

Wait, current_mex is updated by checking while current_mex is in present. 

After adding 2, current_mex starts at 0. 

0 is not in present (present has 2). So current_mex remains 0. 

Next element is 1:

x=1 >=0 → add. present={1,2}, mex=0.

Now, check if 0 is in present. No. So mex remains 0. 

Next element is 0:

x=0 >=0 → add. present={0,1,2}, mex=3.

Wait, current_mex is 0. After adding 0, present becomes {0,1,2}. 

Then, while current_mex (0) is in present: current_mex increments to 1. Then, 1 is in present → increments to 2. 2 is in present → increments to3. 3 is not in present. So current_mex is 3. 

Next element is 2 (leftmost):

x=2 >=3 → no. So not added. 

Thus, count is 3. Which matches the sample output. 

Sample Input 4:

1

777 → output 1. Correct. 

Sample Input 5:

4

1000000000 1 7 9.

Processing from right to left:9,7,1,1e9.

current_mex=0.

9 >=0 → add. present={9}, mex=0. 

7 >=0 → add. present={7,9}, mex=0. 

1 >=0 → add. present={1,7,9}, mex=0. 

current_mex becomes 0. 

Then 1e9 >=0 → add. present={1,7,9, 1e9}, mex=0. 

Thus, count=4. Which matches the sample output. 

Sample Input 6:

2

0 1 → output 2.

Processing from right to left:1,0.

1 >=0 → add. present={1}, mex=0. 

0 >=0 → add. present={0,1}, mex=2. 

Count=2. 

Sample Input 7:

2

1 2 → output 2.

Processing from right to left:2,1.

2 >=0 → add. present={2}, mex=0. 

1 >=0 → add. present={1,2}, mex=0. 

current_mex becomes 0. 

Thus, count=2. 

Sample Input 8:

4

0 1 0 1 → output 3.

Processing from right to left:1,0,1,0.

current_mex=0.

1 >=0 → add. present={1}, mex=0. 

0 >=0 → add. present={0,1}, mex=2. 

Next 1 >=2 → no. 

Next 0 >=2 → no. 

Count=2. 

Wait, sample output is 3. So this approach gives the wrong answer. 

Wait, sample input is 0,1,0,1. The maximum magical subsequence is 3. 

How?

According to the sample output, the answer is 3. 

Let's see:

Possible subsequence: 1,0,1. 

Check the splits:

Split after 1: min(1) >= mex(0,1). mex of [0,1] is 2. 1 >=2 → no. So this is invalid. 

Another possibility: 0,1,0. 

Split after 0: mex of [1,0] is 2. 0 >=2 → no. 

Another possibility: 1,0,0. 

Split after 1: mex([0,0]) is 1. 1 >=1 → yes. 

Split after 0: mex([0]) is 1. min(1,0) is 0 >=1 → no. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, the sample output is 3. 

Perhaps the correct subsequence is [0,1,0]. 

Check:

Split after 0: mex([1,0]) is 2. 0 >=2 → no. 

Alternatively, [1,0,1]. 

Split after 1: mex([0,1}) is 2. 1 >=2 → no. 

Wait, what's the correct magical subsequence?

Sample input 8's output is 3. According to the note, the answer is 3. 

Let's think of a possible subsequence. 

For example, the subsequence [0,1,0]. 

Split after 0: mex([1,0}) is 2. 0 >=2 → no. 

Not valid. 

Another option: [0,0,1]. 

Split after 0: mex([0,1}) is 2. 0 >=2 → no. 

Alternatively, [1,0,1]. 

Split after 1: mex([0,1}) is 2. 1 >=2 → no. 

Alternatively, [1,1,0]. 

Split after first 1: mex([1,0}) is 2. 1 >=2 → no. 

Hmm. 

But according to the sample output, the answer is 3. 

So there must be a magical subsequence of length 3. 

Let's think of [0,1,1]. 

Split after 0: mex([1,1}) is 0. 0 >=0 → yes. 

Split after 1: mex([1}) is 0. min(0,1)=0 >=0 → yes. 

Thus, the subsequence [0,1,1] is valid. 

Yes. So the algorithm should select this. 

But according to the algorithm processing from right to left, let's see:

The array is [0,1,0,1]. Processing in reverse: 1,0,1,0.

current_mex=0.

Process 1 (rightmost):

1 >=0 → add. present={1}, mex=0. 

Process 0 (next):

0 >=0 → add. present={0,1}, mex=2. 

Process 1 (next):

1 >=2 → no. 

Process 0 (leftmost):

0 >=2 → no. 

Count=2. But the sample output is 3. 

So the algorithm fails for this case. 

This indicates that the algorithm is incorrect. 

What's the problem?

The algorithm's approach is to greedily add elements that are >= current_mex and not already present. 

But in the case where elements can be present multiple times, this approach may miss opportunities to add elements that are part of the subsequence but not unique. 

In the sample input 8, the correct subsequence is [0,1,0], but the algorithm adds the first 1 and 0, but the third element is 0, which is already present. 

The algorithm's current approach only adds elements that are not already present, but this is incorrect. 

Ah! This is the mistake. 

The algorithm's condition requires that x is not already in the present set. But this is incorrect. 

Because the subsequence can have duplicate elements. 

The mex is calculated based on the presence of elements, including duplicates. 

But the algorithm's current approach is to add elements only if they are not present in the present set. 

This is incorrect. 

The mex of the elements after x is determined by the elements in the suffix, including duplicates. 

But the algorithm's current approach uses a set, which ignores duplicates, leading to incorrect mex calculations. 

Thus, the algorithm is incorrect. 

This explains why the algorithm fails for sample input 8. 

So, the correct approach should allow duplicate elements in the subsequence, but track their presence in a multiset. 

But how to compute mex correctly when there are duplicates. 

Wait, mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the collection. So, even if an element is present multiple times, its presence is checked for the mex. 

Thus, duplicates do not affect the mex computation. 

For example, the collection [0,0,1] has mex 2. 

So, the algorithm's mistake is to track elements in a set rather than a multiset. 

Thus, the correct approach is to allow multiple elements in the subsequence, but track the presence of elements in a way that allows multiple occurrences. 

But mex is determined by the presence of the element, not its count. 

Thus, for mex computation, it's sufficient to track whether an element is present or not, regardless of how many times it occurs. 

So, the algorithm's current approach of using a set is correct for mex computation. 

However, the algorithm's condition of adding x only if it is not present in the set is incorrect. 

Because, even if x is already present in the set, adding x to the subsequence is allowed, as long as x >= current_mex. 

For example, in the sample input 8, the subsequence [0,1,0] can be formed. 

Processing from right to left: elements are 1,0,1,0. 

The algorithm would process as follows:

current_mex=0.

Process 1 (rightmost):

1 >=0 → add to present. present={0,1}? No. 

Wait, initial current_mex=0. 

Processing the rightmost 1:

x=1 >=0. present is empty. So add to present. present becomes {1}. current_mex is updated to 0 (since 0 is not in present). 

Next element is 0 (third element):

0 >=0 → add. present becomes {0,1}. current_mex is updated to 2.

Next element is 1 (second element):

1 >=2 → no. Skip.

Next element is 0 (first element):

0 >=2 → no. Skip.

Thus, count=2. 

But the correct subsequence [0,1,0] would require adding the third 0 (processing from right to left). 

But according to the algorithm, the third 0 (which is the third element in the array) is processed first. 

Wait, the array is [0,1,0,1]. Processing from right to left gives the elements 1,0,1,0. 

Let's re-examine:

For the correct subsequence [0,1,0], the order in the array is 0,1,0. 

But when processing from right to left, the elements are 1,0,1,0. 

So, the algorithm would process the elements in this order:

1 (index 3): added. present={1}. current_mex=0. 

0 (index 2): added. present={0,1}. current_mex=2. 

1 (index 1): 1 <2 → skipped. 

0 (index 0): 0 <2 → skipped. 

Count=2. 

But the correct subsequence has three elements. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach is not correct. 

The problem is that the algorithm requires elements to be >= current_mex and not present in the set. But this prevents adding duplicate elements even when they are needed. 

So, the algorithm's condition is incorrect. 

The correct condition is that x >= current_mex, regardless of whether x is already present. 

Thus, the algorithm should remove the condition that x is not in present. 

Thus, the corrected algorithm is:

Initialize current_mex=0, present=set(), count=0.

Process elements from right to left:

for x in reversed(a):

    if x >= current_mex:

        present.add(x)

        count +=1

        while current_mex in present:

            current_mex +=1

Thus, even if x is already present in the set, we add it again (but since present is a set, adding it again has no effect). 

Wait, but this would not allow duplicates. 

Ah, right. Because present is a set, adding x again does not change the set. 

But the subsequence can include duplicates. 

The problem is that the algorithm uses a set to track the elements, which disallows duplicates. 

But mex is computed based on the presence of elements, not their counts. 

Thus, the algorithm should track which elements are present in the suffix, regardless of their count. 

But when building the subsequence, duplicates can be allowed as long as their presence is tracked. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach of using a set to track presence is correct for mex computation. 

But the condition of adding x >= current_mex regardless of whether x is present is needed. 

So, the corrected algorithm is:

Initialize current_mex=0, present=set(), count=0.

Process elements from right to left:

for x in reversed(a):

    if x >= current_mex:

        if x not in present:

            present.add(x)

            while current_mex in present:

                current_mex +=1

        count +=1

Thus, even if x is already in present, it's added to the subsequence (count is increased), but present is not modified. 

This way, the algorithm allows duplicates in the subsequence, but tracks the presence of elements for mex computation. 

Let's test this on sample input 8:

Sample Input 8:

4

0 1 0 1 → output 3.

Processing from right to left: 1,0,1,0.

current_mex=0, present=empty, count=0.

Process 1:

1 >=0 → yes. 

x not in present → add to present. present={1}. 

current_mex becomes 0. 

count becomes 1.

Process 0:

0 >=0 → yes. 

x not in present → add. present={0,1}. 

current_mex becomes 2. 

count=2.

Process 1:

1 >=2 → no. skip.

Process 0:

0 >=2 → no. skip.

count=2. 

But sample output is 3. 

This approach also fails. 

But the correct subsequence is [0,1,0]. How to include it. 

When processing the first 1 (rightmost):

1 >=0 → added. present={1}, current_mex=0. count=1.

Then processing 0 (third element):

0 >=0 → added. present={0,1}, current_mex=2. count=2.

Then processing 1 (second element):

1 >=2 → no. 

Then processing 0 (first element):

0 >=2 → no. 

Thus, count=2. 

But the correct subsequence is [0,1,0]. 

In this case, the algorithm's approach is not sufficient. 

This indicates that the algorithm's approach is still incorrect. 

The problem is that the mex is computed based on the elements present, but the subsequence may include elements even if they are already present. 

For example, in the correct subsequence [0,1,0], the first 0 (third element in the array) is added. The second element 1 (second element in the array) is added. The third element 0 (first element in the array) is added. 

But when processing the third element 0 (first element in the array, processed last), current_mex is 2. 0 >=2 is false. So it's not added. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach is unable to include the third 0. 

This suggests that the algorithm's approach is not correct. 

Thus, a different approach is needed. 

Alternative Idea:

The mex of the suffix after x is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the suffix. 

To ensure x >= mex, we need to ensure that x is greater than or equal to the mex of the suffix. 

But the mex of the suffix depends on the elements in the suffix. 

So, the correct algorithm must track the elements in the suffix and their mex. 

Thus, the algorithm should process elements from right to left, adding elements x to the subsequence if x >= current_mex. 

But current_mex is the mex of the elements already in the suffix. 

When x is added to the subsequence, it becomes part of the prefix. The suffix is the elements already added to the right of x. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach should be:

current_mex is the mex of the suffix. 

When processing x:

if x >= current_mex:

   add x to the subsequence. 

   update the suffix (elements after x) to include x. 

   recompute current_mex as the mex of the suffix. 

But how to track the suffix. 

But the suffix is the elements already added to the subsequence. 

Thus, the algorithm should track the elements in the suffix and their mex. 

The correct algorithm would process elements from right to left, maintaining a set of elements in the suffix. 

When x is processed, the current_mex is the mex of the suffix. 

If x >= current_mex:

   add x to the subsequence. 

   add x to the suffix set. 

   update current_mex by checking from current_mex upwards until a missing element is found. 

Else:

   skip x. 

Thus, the algorithm would be:

Initialize:

current_mex =0.

suffix_set = empty set.

count=0.

Process elements from right to left:

for x in reversed(a):

    if x >= current_mex:

        suffix_set.add(x)

        count +=1

        # update current_mex.

        while current_mex in suffix_set:

            current_mex +=1

    else:

        pass

This way, the suffix_set contains all elements in the suffix (elements added to the right of the current x). 

Let's test this on sample input 8:

Sample Input 8:

4

0 1 0 1 → elements processed in reverse order:1,0,1,0.

current_mex=0, suffix_set is empty.

Process x=1 (rightmost):

1 >=0 → add to suffix_set. count=1. current_mex is 0, check if 0 is in suffix_set (contains 1). No. So current_mex remains 0. 

Process x=0 (third element):

0 >=0 → add to suffix_set (now {0,1}). count=2. current_mex=0. 

Check if 0 is in suffix_set → yes. current_mex becomes 1. 

Check if 1 is in suffix_set → yes. current_mex becomes 2. 

Process x=1 (second element):

1 >=2 → no. skipped.

Process x=0 (first element):

0 >=2 → no. skipped.

count=2. 

But the sample output is 3. 

Thus, this approach also fails. 

Hmm. What's the correct way to track the suffix_set and current_mex?

In the correct subsequence [0,1,0], the elements are added in the order 0,1,0 (from left to right in the original array). 

But processing from right to left, the elements are 1,0,1,0. 

In the correct subsequence, the suffix after the first 0 (leftmost) is [0,1]. The mex is 2. The element 0 is added because 0 >=2 is false. 

This suggests that the algorithm's approach of checking x >= current_mex is not sufficient. 

Thus, the problem is more complex. 

Alternative Idea: For the subsequence to be magical, each element must be >= the mex of the elements after it. 

Thus, the mex of the elements after x is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the elements after x. 

This is independent of whether x is included in the subsequence. 

Thus, the algorithm must track, for each element x, the mex of the elements after x in the original array. 

But this is computationally expensive. 

Alternatively, we can precompute for each position the mex of the elements to the right. 

But this may not work, as the elements to the right are not necessarily in the subsequence. 

Thus, it's unclear. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the algorithm where we process elements from right to left, adding them if they are >= current_mex, and track the mex of the suffix. 

But this fails for some cases. 

However, in the sample input 8, the correct answer is 3, but the algorithm gives 2. 

Thus, perhaps the algorithm is not sufficient. 

But given that the other samples pass, and the problem is likely intended to have this solution, perhaps the correct approach is to use this algorithm and accept that it may not handle cases like sample 8. 

But why does the sample 8's output is 3?

Looking back at sample input 8:

Input: 0 1 0 1 → output 3. 

The correct subsequence must be magical. Let's think of [0,0,1]. 

Split after 0:

min(0) =0. mex of the suffix [0,1] is 2. 0 >=2 → no. 

Thus, this is invalid. 

Another possibility: [0,1,1]. 

Split after 0: mex([1,1] is 0. 0 >=0 → yes. 

Split after 1: mex([1] is 0. min(0,1) is 0 >=0 → yes. 

Thus, this is valid. 

So the subsequence [0,1,1] is valid. 

But in the array, the elements are [0,1,0,1]. 

Thus, the subsequence is formed by the first, second, and fourth elements (0,1,1). 

Processing from right to left, the elements are 1 (fourth),0 (third),1 (second),0 (first). 

Algorithm:

current_mex=0. 

Process 1 (fourth element):

1 >=0 → add. suffix_set={1}, current_mex=0. count=1. 

Process 0 (third element):

0 >=0 → add. suffix_set={0,1}, current_mex=2. count=2. 

Process 1 (second element):

1 >=2 → no. 

Process 0 (first element):

0 >=2 → no. 

Thus, the algorithm's count is 2. 

But the correct subsequence is 3. 

Thus, the algorithm is incorrect. 

This indicates that the algorithm is not correct. 

Thus, the problem requires a different approach. 

Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the mex of the suffix is the current mex, and that the elements can be added even if they are present in the suffix. 

But how to track this. 

Another Idea:

The mex of the suffix after x is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the suffix. 

When processing elements from right to left, the current mex is the mex of the elements already added to the subsequence. 

Thus, when x is added, the mex of the suffix becomes the mex of the elements already added. 

But x is added to the prefix. The elements already added are to the right of x, so x is not part of the suffix. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach is correct. 

But in the case where the same element is added multiple times, the mex may not increase. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach of adding elements >= current_mex and updating the present set is correct. 

But in sample input 8, the correct subsequence requires adding two 1's and a 0, but the algorithm fails to do so. 

Thus, perhaps the algorithm is incorrect and there's a need to find a different approach. 

Given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the algorithm, which passes all samples except sample 8. 

But the sample 8's correct answer is 3. 

But according to the algorithm, it's 2. 

This suggests that the algorithm is incorrect and the correct approach is different. 

Alternative Idea:

The problem requires that for each element x in the subsequence, x is >= the mex of the elements after x. 

Thus, the mex of the elements after x in the subsequence. 

To find the longest such subsequence, perhaps we can model it as follows:

We need to select a subsequence S such that for each i in S, S[i] >= mex(S[i+1...k]). 

This can be viewed as a dynamic programming problem. For each position in the array, we track the possible mex values of the suffix. 

But this approach would be O(n^2) which is not feasible for n=2e5. 

Thus, the only feasible approach is the greedy one. 

But how to handle cases where elements are repeated. 

The correct approach may involve allowing elements to be added even if they are already in the present set. 

Thus, the algorithm should be modified to not track the present set, but instead track the mex of the elements in the suffix. 

But how to compute the mex efficiently. 

Another Idea:

The mex of the suffix after x is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the suffix. 

If we can track the mex while allowing duplicates, then the algorithm can be adjusted. 

But mex is not affected by duplicates. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach of using a set is correct. 

But the condition should allow adding elements even if they are already present. 

Thus, the corrected algorithm is:

current_mex=0.

present=set().

count=0.

for x in reversed(a):

    if x >= current_mex:

        if x not in present:

            present.add(x)

            while current_mex in present:

                current_mex +=1

        count +=1

    else:

        pass

Thus, even if x is already in present, we add it to the count, but do not modify the present set. 

In sample input 8:

Processing elements 1,0,1,0.

Process 1:

1 >=0 → add to present. present={1}, mex=0 → while 0 not in present → mex remains 0. count=1.

Process 0:

0 >=0 → add to present. present={0,1}, mex becomes 2. count=2.

Process 1:

1 >=2 → no. count remains 2.

Process 0:

0 >=2 → no. count remains 2. 

Thus, the algorithm's count is 2. 

But the correct answer is 3. 

Thus, the algorithm is still incorrect. 

In the correct subsequence [0,1,1], the two 1's are included. 

When processing the second 1 (element index 1):

x=1 >= current_mex (0) → add to count. present is already {1}, so present is not modified. current_mex remains 0. count=3. 

Then processing the first 0 (element index 0):

x=0 >=0 → add to count. present becomes {0,1}. current_mex is updated to 2. count=4. 

But this would result in a count of 4, which is invalid. 

But the sample input's answer is 3. 

Thus, this suggests that the algorithm's approach is not correct and that there's a need for a different approach. 

Given the time constraints and the fact that the initial algorithm passes most of the samples except one, perhaps the intended solution is the initial algorithm but with a different approach. 

But I'm not able to find the correct approach. 

Perhaps the correct solution is to realize that the maximum possible length is the number of elements from 0 up to mex(a) -1 plus the number of elements greater than mex(a). 

But this is just a hypothesis. 

Alternatively, the maximum possible length is the number of elements that are >= the mex of the entire array. 

But this is not correct. 

Alternatively, the answer is the mex of the entire array plus the number of elements greater than the mex. 

But I'm not sure. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the algorithm that processes elements from right to left, adding them if x >= current_mex, and tracks the mex of the elements added. 

This passes all the samples except sample 8, but according to the problem's demo input, the correct answer for sample 8 is 3. 

Thus, the algorithm must be incorrect. 

But given the time and the problem's complexity, I'll proceed with the algorithm and hope that the code passes the test cases. 

But I'm aware that this may not be correct for all cases. 

The code for the algorithm would be:

For each test case:

- Read the array.

- Initialize a set 'present' and variables current_mex=0, count=0.

- Process elements from right to left.

- For each element:

   if x >= current_mex:

       add x to 'present' (if not already present)

       increment count.

       update current_mex by checking from current_mex upwards.

- Return count.

The code would look like this in Python:

for each test case:
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    present = set()
    current_mex = 0
    count = 0
    for x in reversed(a):
        if x >= current_mex:
            if x not in present:
                present.add(x)
                while current_mex in present:
                    current_mex += 1
            count +=1
    print(count)

Testing this code on sample input 8:

Input: 0 1 0 1 → [0,1,0,1]

Processing from right to left:

1 → add to present. current_mex becomes 0 (since 0 is not in present). count=1.

0 → add to present. current_mex becomes 2. count=2.

1 → 1 >=2 → no. count remains 2.

0 → 0 >=2 → no. count remains 2. 

Thus, code returns 2, but the correct answer is 3. 

Thus, this code is incorrect for sample 8. 

But according to the sample input 8's output, the answer is 3. 

Thus, this suggests that the algorithm is incorrect. 

But I'm stuck and can't find the correct approach. 

Perhaps the correct approach is to allow elements to be added even if they are not part of the present set. 

But how to track the mex. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to allow elements to be added regardless of their presence, but compute the mex of the suffix for each possible split. 

But this is not feasible for large n. 

Thus, given the time, I'll proceed with the initial approach and code, noting that it may not pass all test cases. 

But according to the sample input 8's note, the correct answer is 3. 

So, perhaps the correct subsequence is [0,1,0], where the splits are:

Split after 0: mex([1,0}) is 2. min(0) >=2 → no. 

This is invalid. 

Thus, I must have made a mistake in understanding the sample input 8. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer for sample input 8 is 3, but my reasoning is incorrect. 

Let me re-examine the sample input 8:

Input: 0 1 0 1

Output: 3.

Possible valid subsequence:

Let's take the first 0, then the 1, then the second 0. 

Split after first 0: min(0) >= mex([1,0}).

mex([1,0}) is 2. 0 >=2 → no. 

Thus, invalid. 

Another possible subsequence: 1, 0, 0. 

Split after 1: min(1) >= mex([0,0}) → 1 >=1 → yes.

Split after 0: min(1,0) =0 >= mex([0}) → 0 >=1 → no. 

Thus, invalid. 

Another possibility: 1,0,1. 

Split after 1: min(1) >= mex([0,1} → 2. 1 >=2 → no. 

Thus, invalid. 

Another possibility: 0,0,1. 

Split after first 0: mex([0,1} →2. 0 >=2 → no. 

Thus, invalid. 

Another possibility: 0,1,1. 

Split after first 0: mex([1,1} →0. 0 >=0 → yes. 

Split after 1: mex([1} →0. min(0,1) →0 >=0 → yes. 

Thus, valid. 

Thus, this subsequence is valid. 

The elements are [0,1,1]. 

The code, when processing this:

Elements are processed in reverse order: 1,0,1,0. 

Processing 1 (index 3):

1 >=0 → add to present. present={1}, current_mex=0. count=1. 

Processing 0 (index 2):

0 >=0 → add to present. present={0,1}, current_mex=2. count=2. 

Processing 1 (index 1):

1 >=2 → no. 

Processing 0 (index 0):

0 >=2 → no. 

Thus, count=2. 

But the correct subsequence is formed by the elements at indices 0,1,3 (0,1,1). 

Thus, the code does not add the third element (1 at index 3) because it was already added. 

But the code's present set is a set, so it doesn't allow duplicates. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach of using a set is incorrect. 

Thus, the correct approach must allow duplicates in the present set. 

Thus, the algorithm should use a multiset (count occurrences) to track elements. 

But mex is determined by presence, not count. 

Thus, the algorithm should track which elements are present, regardless of their count. 

Thus, the algorithm's approach of using a set is correct for mex computation, but the condition should allow adding elements even if they are already present. 

Thus, the algorithm should add x to the subsequence if x >= current_mex, regardless of whether x is present in the set. 

But the present set is only updated if x is not present. 

Thus, the code should be modified to increment the count even if x is already present. 

Thus, the corrected code is:

for each test case:
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    present = set()
    current_mex = 0
    count =0
    for x in reversed(a):
        if x >= current_mex:
            if x not in present:
                present.add(x)
                while current_mex in present:
                    current_mex +=1
            count +=1
    print(count)

This code allows adding x even if it's already present. 

Let's test this on sample input 8:

Processing 1 (index 3):

x=1 >=0 → add to present. present={1}, current_mex becomes 0. count=1.

Processing 0 (index 2):

x=0 >=0 → add to present. present={0,1}, current_mex becomes 2. count=2.

Processing 1 (index 1):

x=1 >=2 → no. count remains 2.

Processing 0 (index 0):

x=0 >=2 → no. count remains 2. 

Thus, the code returns 2, but the correct answer is 3. 

Thus, this code is still incorrect. 

Thus, I'm stuck and unable to find the correct approach. 

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial code and note that it passes the samples except for sample 8. 

But according to the sample input 8's output, the code is incorrect. 

But I'm not able to find the correct approach. 

Thus, the code for the problem is as follows:
