To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of 1x1 squares that are at least half inside the triangle formed by the points A(a, 0), B(0, b), and C(0, 0). The solution involves calculating the number of such squares efficiently using integer arithmetic to avoid precision issues.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The triangle is defined by the line equation \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \). A square is considered part of the triangle if its center (x+0.5, y+0.5) lies within or on the triangle.
2. **Key Insight**: For each column x, we compute the maximum row y such that the center of the square (x, y) is inside the triangle. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point precision errors.
3. **Efficient Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we derive the formula for the maximum y for each x and sum the valid counts across all columns from 0 to a-1.

### Solution Code
```python
a, b = map(int, input().split())
total = 0
for x in range(a):
    numerator = 2 * b * (a - x) - b - a
    y_max = numerator // (2 * a)
    if y_max >= 0:
        total += y_max + 1
print(total)
```

### Explanation
1. **Integer Arithmetic**: The formula to compute the maximum y for each x is derived using integer arithmetic to avoid precision issues. The numerator is calculated as \( 2b(a - x) - b - a \), and the denominator is \( 2a \).
2. **Loop Through Columns**: For each column x from 0 to a-1, compute the maximum valid row y using the derived formula. If the result is non-negative, add the count of valid rows (y_max + 1) to the total.
3. **Summation**: The total sum of all valid squares across all columns gives the required result.

This approach efficiently computes the result in O(a) time complexity, which is feasible even for the upper constraints of a and b up to \( 10^6 \). The use of integer arithmetic ensures precision and avoids floating-point errors.
