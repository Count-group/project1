To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a robot's strategy (defined by probabilities q1, q2, q3) will result in a non-negative expected score in each of n games against other robots. The solution involves calculating the feasible region where all expected scores are non-negative and computing the area of this region relative to the entire probability simplex.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot's strategy must ensure that the expected score for each game is non-negative. The feasible region for these strategies is a convex polygon within the probability simplex defined by q1 + q2 + q3 = 1, q1 ≥ 0, q2 ≥ 0, q3 ≥ 0.

2. **Constraints Handling**: Each game imposes a linear constraint on the feasible region. We iteratively clip the initial simplex (a triangle) using each game's constraint to form the feasible region.

3. **Clipping Algorithm**: Using the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm, we clip the polygon against each constraint line to maintain the feasible region. This algorithm checks each edge of the polygon against the constraint and updates the polygon vertices accordingly.

4. **Area Calculation**: After processing all constraints, the area of the resulting polygon is calculated using the shoelace formula. The probability is the ratio of this area to the area of the entire simplex.

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the matrix A and the probability distributions for each game.
2. **Constraint Calculation**: For each game, we compute the coefficients of the linear constraint based on the matrix A and the given probabilities.
3. **Clipping Process**: The initial simplex is iteratively clipped against each constraint using the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm to maintain the feasible region.
4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the feasible region is computed using the shoelace formula, and the probability is derived by comparing this area to the entire simplex area.

This approach efficiently handles up to 10,000 constraints and ensures the solution meets the required precision by carefully managing floating-point operations and edge cases.
