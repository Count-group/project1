Okay, I need to solve this problem where for each test case, given the first n elements of a binary sequence, I have to compute a single element a_m where m is given (since l and r are the same). The problem is to find a_m efficiently, especially since m can be up to 1e18. Let's think about how the sequence is generated.

The key point is that for m > n, a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements. Wait, no, wait. Wait the definition says a_m is equal to a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{floor(m/2)}. So each term after n is the cumulative XOR up to floor(m/2). Hmm. But how does this sequence progress? Let's try to see for small values.

Let's take the first sample input where n=1, a_1=1. For m>1, a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements. Let's see:

a_2: floor(2/2)=1. So XOR of first 1 elements (a_1) which is 1. So a_2=1.
a_3: floor(3/2)=1. XOR of a_1 is 1. So a_3=1.
a_4: floor(4/2)=2. XOR of a_1 and a_2 (both 1) → 0. So a_4=0.
a_5: floor(5/2)=2. XOR same as a_4, so 0.
a_6: floor(6/2)=3. XOR a_1, a_2, a_3 → 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 → 1.
So a_6=1.
So the sequence starts as [1,1,1,0,0,1,...]. So for m=1, the output is 1. For m=3, it's 1.

So the problem is to compute a_m given m, which can be very large. How do we compute this efficiently?

Let's think recursively. For any m, if m <=n, then a_m is known. If m >n, then a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements. But the first floor(m/2) elements may themselves include elements that are beyond n, so they are computed based on previous elements.

So the value of a_m depends on the XOR up to floor(m/2) elements. But calculating this directly for large m is impossible. So we need a way to compute a_m without processing all elements up to m.

Wait, but the sequence is defined recursively. Let's see. For example, suppose m is very large. To compute a_m, we need the XOR of the first k elements where k is floor(m/2). Then that XOR is the sum (mod 2) of those elements. But how can we compute that sum efficiently?

Wait, the problem requires us to compute a_m for a single m, and m can be up to 1e18. So for each query, we need to find a way to compute a_m in O(log m) time or something similar.

Hmm. Let's model this as a function f(m) which returns a_m. Then:

f(m) = a_m (if m <=n)
f(m) = xor_sum(floor(m/2)) mod 2 (since the elements are 0 or 1, XOR is equivalent to sum modulo 2).

But xor_sum(floor(m/2)) is the sum of a_1 to a_k mod 2, where k = floor(m/2). So f(m) = sum_{i=1}^k a_i mod 2, where k = floor(m/2).

But then, to compute this sum, we need to know the sum up to k. But k can be larger than n. So sum up to k is sum_{i=1}^n a_i (given) plus sum_{i=n+1}^k a_i. Each a_i in this latter sum is equal to sum_{j=1}^floor(i/2) a_j mod 2. Wait, that's getting complicated. Because each a_i for i >n is the sum up to floor(i/2) mod 2.

So, the sum up to k can be split into the initial sum (for i <=n) plus the sum from n+1 to k of a_i, where each a_i is sum_{j=1}^{floor(i/2)} a_j mod 2.

This seems like a recursive problem, but perhaps we can find a pattern or a way to memoize the sums.

Alternatively, let's model the sum up to k. Let S(k) be the sum of a_1 to a_k mod 2. Then, for m >n, a_m is S( floor(m/2) ) mod 2. But S(k) can be written as S_initial (sum of first n elements) plus sum_{i =n+1}^k a_i mod 2.

But each a_i for i>n is S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

So, S(k) = (sum_{i=1}^n a_i + sum_{i=n+1}^k (S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2 )) mod 2.

But how can we compute this for large k?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern that S(k) can be determined based on the path of k when divided by 2 multiple times until it reaches a value <=n.

Let's think recursively. Let's suppose we need to compute S(m), which is the sum up to m. For each i from 1 to m, a_i is either known (if i <=n) or the sum up to floor(i/2) mod 2.

Wait, but for m >=n+1, the a_i's are determined by the sum up to floor(i/2). So the sum up to some k can be broken down into:

sum_{i=1}^n a_i (given) + sum_{i=n+1}^k a_i.

Each a_i in the second sum is S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

But S( floor(i/2) ) is the sum up to floor(i/2) mod 2.

So, for each i>n, a_i is equal to S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

But then, the sum from i=n+1 to k of a_i is equal to the sum of (S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2) for i from n+1 to k.

But computing this sum mod 2 is equivalent to (sum of those terms) mod 2. So S(k) = (initial_sum + sum_{i=n+1}^k a_i) mod 2.

But each a_i is S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

This seems like a recursive problem. Let's model it as such.

So, for a given m, to compute a_m, which is S( floor(m/2) ) mod 2. So a_m = S( floor(m/2) ) % 2.

But S( floor(m/2) ) is the sum up to floor(m/2), which may be computed as follows:

If floor(m/2) <=n, then S( floor(m/2) ) is the sum of the first floor(m/2) elements (given as input).

Otherwise, we need to compute S( floor(m/2) ) which is (sum of initial a_i's up to n) plus the sum of a_i from i=n+1 to floor(m/2), where each a_i is S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

So this is a recursive function. But how can we compute this efficiently?

Let's think of the problem for a single m. The process of computing a_m is:

Compute the sum of a_1 to a_{floor(m/2)}, mod 2. But to compute that sum, we need to compute S( floor(m/2) ), which may require further recursion.

But the recursion depth is logarithmic in m, since each step halves the value. For example, for m up to 1e18, log2(m) is about 60 steps. So this suggests that for each query, the time is O(log m), which is acceptable for t=1e4 queries.

So the plan is:

For a given m (since l=r=m), compute a_m as follows:

If m <=n: return a[m-1] (assuming 0-based index).

Else, compute the sum of the first k = floor(m/2) elements mod 2. Then return that sum mod 2 as a_m.

So the key is to compute the sum up to k (floor(m/2)) mod 2. Let's see how to compute that sum.

To compute sum up to k (S(k)), if k <=n, then it's the sum of a_1 to a_k mod 2.

If k >n, then S(k) = (sum_initial + sum_{i=n+1}^k a_i) mod 2, where sum_initial is the sum of a_1 to a_n mod 2, and each a_i for i>n is S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

So the sum from i=n+1 to k of a_i mod 2 is sum_{i=n+1 to k} S( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

But that's tricky. Let's think about how to compute this sum.

Wait, perhaps we can model the sum as a function of k. Let's denote for a given x, f(x) is the sum of a_i from i=1 to x mod 2.

We need to compute f(k), which is the sum up to k mod 2.

For x <=n: f(x) is known as the sum of the first x elements.

For x>n: f(x) = (f(n) + sum_{i=n+1}^x a_i) mod 2.

But each a_i in the sum from n+1 to x is equal to f( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

So sum_{i=n+1}^x a_i mod 2 is equal to (sum_{i=n+1}^x f( floor(i/2) )) mod 2.

So f(x) = (f(n) + sum_{i=n+1}^x f( floor(i/2) )) mod 2.

Hmm. How can we compute this sum?

This seems like a recursive problem. For example, to compute f(x), we need to compute sum of f( floor(i/2) ) for i from n+1 to x.

But each of those terms is f of some value, which in turn may require summing further.

But again, each time you compute floor(i/2), the value is halved. So for large i, the recursion depth is logarithmic.

So perhaps we can model this with memoization, but for 1e18, even memoization may not be feasible.

Alternatively, let's think of the sum as a function that can be computed recursively. Let's think of the sum from i = a to b of f( floor(i/2) ) mod 2. How can we compute this?

Suppose we can split the sum into even and odd parts. For example, for each i in a..b:

If i is even: floor(i/2) = i/2.

If i is odd: floor(i/2) = (i-1)/2.

But perhaps there's a way to group terms by their floor(i/2) value.

Alternatively, for a given interval [a, b], the sum of f( floor(i/2) ) is equal to sum_{k= floor(a/2) }^{ floor(b/2) } (number of i in [a, b] where floor(i/2) =k ) * f(k) mod 2.

But the number of i's where floor(i/2) =k is 1 if k*2+1 is in [a,b], and 2 if k*2 and k*2+1 are in [a,b]. Or perhaps more precisely, for each k, the numbers i that map to k are 2k and 2k+1. So for a given k, the count is how many numbers in [a, b] are in [2k, 2k+1].

So the sum over i from a to b of f( floor(i/2) ) mod 2 is equal to sum_{k= floor(a/2) }^{ floor(b/2) } (count_k) * f(k) mod 2, where count_k is the number of i in [a, b] such that floor(i/2) =k.

But since we're working mod 2, (count_k * f(k)) mod 2 is equivalent to (count_k mod 2) * f(k). So if count_k is even, the term is 0. If count_k is odd, the term is f(k).

So the sum mod 2 is equal to the sum over all k where count_k is odd of f(k), mod 2.

Therefore, the sum from a to b of f( floor(i/2) ) mod 2 is equal to the sum of f(k) for each k where the count of i's in [a,b] that map to k is odd.

So how can we compute this efficiently?

For example, the interval [a, b] can be split into:

- the start part (from a to the first even number in [a, b] if a is odd)

- then blocks of even and odd pairs (each pair contributes two terms to the same k)

- the end part (from the last even number to b if b is odd).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that each pair of consecutive numbers (even, odd) maps to the same k. For example, 2k and 2k+1 both map to k. So if the interval [a, b] contains 2k and 2k+1, then their contributions to the count_k is 2, which mod 2 is 0. So only if the interval has an odd number of elements for a certain k, then count_k is 1 mod 2.

So for the interval [a, b], the count_k is odd if and only if the number of elements in the interval that map to k is odd. For example:

If the interval starts and ends within the same k pair (like a=2k, b=2k → count is 1, so odd. a=2k, b=2k+1 → count is 2 → even. a=2k+1, b=2k+1 → count 1 → odd.

So perhaps the sum mod 2 can be computed by considering the start and end parts.

Let me think. For the interval [a, b], the number of elements is (b -a +1). The sum is the parity (mod 2) of the number of k's where the count is odd.

Alternatively, the sum is equal to the sum of f(k) for all k where the count is odd.

So how do I find all k's where the count is odd?

Let me represent each i in [a, b] as i = 2k or 2k+1.

The count for each k is the number of i's in [a, b] that are in the interval [2k, 2k+1].

So for each i in [a, b], compute k = floor(i/2). The count for each k is how many times this k appears.

We need to find all k where the count is odd.

This is equivalent to the symmetric difference of the set of k's in the start and end of the interval.

Alternatively, the k's where the count is odd are the k's that are covered an odd number of times by the interval.

But how?

Let me think of the interval [a, b] as a range of integers. For each k, the numbers 2k and 2k+1 are mapped to k.

If the interval [a, b] starts at 2k and ends at 2k+1, then all numbers in this interval are 2k, 2k+1. The count for k is 2, which is even → 0. So sum mod 2 is 0.

But if the interval is, say, from 2k to 2k, then count is 1 (odd) → sum += f(k).

If the interval starts at 2k and ends at 2k+2, then:

2k → k

2k+1 → k

2k+2 → k+1

So counts:

k: 2 (even), k+1: 1 (odd). So sum is f(k+1).

So sum mod 2 is f(k+1).

So the sum depends on the parity of the count for each k in the interval.

So, to compute this sum for [a, b], the steps would be:

1. Compute the first and last k in the interval.

But how?

Alternatively, the approach is to split the interval [a, b] into three parts:

- a possible leading part (if a is even or odd)

- a middle part consisting of full pairs (even and odd numbers)

- a possible trailing part.

But since each full pair contributes 0 mod 2 (count is 2, which is even), only the leading and trailing parts contribute.

So, for example:

If a is even and b is even:

Then the interval can be split into pairs (a, a+1), (a+2, a+3), ..., (b-1, b). But wait, if a is even and b is even, then the interval has (b -a)/1 +1 elements. Wait, no: for example, a=2, b=4. The elements are 2,3,4. So 2 and 3 form a pair (k=1), and 4 is part of k=2. So the count for k=1 is 2 (even), for k=2 is 1 (odd). So sum is f(2).

So the sum for the interval is f(2).

But the way to compute this is to note that the leading part is a (if a is even, then the first element is 2k → k = a/2. But if a is even, then a is part of a pair only if a+1 is in the interval.

Alternatively, maybe the sum is determined by whether the interval starts and ends on even or odd numbers.

Another approach: the sum of f(k) for k where the count of i in [a, b] with floor(i/2) =k is odd is equal to the sum of f(k) for k in the set { floor(a/2), floor(b/2) }, and any k where there's an odd number of i's in the interval that map to k.

But I'm not seeing the pattern here.

Alternative idea: when you have a continuous range of i's from a to b, the parity of the count of i's for each k is determined by the parity of the number of elements in the range that map to k.

But how to find which k's have odd counts?

Another approach: for the interval [a, b], the k's involved start at floor(a/2) and end at floor(b/2).

Each k in [start_k, end_k] could be included.

But the count for each k is the number of i in [a, b] where floor(i/2) =k.

The count for k is equal to:

If 2k >=a and 2k+1 <=b → count is 2 (even, so no contribution).

If 2k >=a and 2k+1 >b → count is (b -2k +1) if 2k <=b. So if 2k <=b <2k+1, then count is 1 (since i=2k is in [a, b] → but if 2k >=a and 2k <=b → count is 1. If 2k+1 is not in [a, b], then count is 1. So for example, if a=2k and b=2k → count is 1.

Similarly for other cases.

But this seems complicated.

Alternative plan: for a given interval [a, b], the sum is f( floor(a/2) ) if a is even, plus f( floor(b/2) ) if b is odd, and then mod 2.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the interval is from a to b.

For example, if a is even and b is even:

Take a=4, b=6. The numbers are 4,5,6.

4 → k=2

5 →k=2

6 →k=3

So the count for k=2 is 2 (even), k=3 is 1 (odd). Sum is f(3).

But a is even (4), and b is even (6). So floor(a/2)=2, floor(b/2)=3. So the sum is f(3), which is the floor(b/2).

Another example: a=5 (odd), b=7 (odd). Numbers are 5,6,7.

5 →k=2

6 →k=3

7 →k=3

Counts: k=2 has 1 (odd), k=3 has 2 (even). Sum is f(2).

Here, floor(a/2)=2, floor(b/2)=3. The sum is f(2), which is floor(a/2).

Another example: a=5 (odd), b=8 (even). Numbers 5,6,7,8.

k=2 (5), k=3 (6,7), k=4 (8).

Counts: k=2:1, k=3:2, k=4:1. So sum is f(2) + f(4) mod 2.

But floor(a/2)=2, floor(b/2)=4. So the sum is f(2) + f(4) mod 2.

Hmm. So perhaps the sum is equal to the sum of f(k) for all k in the set { floor(a/2), floor(b/2) } if (a is odd and a <=b) or (b is even and a <=b). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the sum is the sum of f(k) where k is floor(a/2) if a is odd, plus floor(b/2) if b is even.

Wait, let's think again. For each i in [a, b], the k is floor(i/2).

If a is odd, then the first element is a=2k+1, which maps to k. The next elements (if a+1 is in the interval) are even and odd pairs.

Similarly, if b is even, then the last element is 2k, which maps to k. The previous elements (if b-1 is in the interval) are pairs.

So, the sum of f(k) for the interval [a, b] is equal to:

sum = (if a is odd → f( floor(a/2) )) + (if b is even → f( floor(b/2) )) mod 2.

Because:

- For a odd: the first element a is 2k+1 → floor(a/2) =k. If there are more elements after a, then the next elements are even and odd pairs. For example, a=5 (k=2), then 6 (k=3), 7 (k=3). The pair 6 and 7 contributes 0. So the only k with odd count is k=2 (from a=5) and if b is even, then the last element is even, which is 2k → contributing k.

So this seems to be the case. So the sum mod 2 is equal to (if a is odd, add f( floor(a/2) )) + (if b is even, add f( floor(b/2) )) mod 2.

Let's test this with previous examples.

Example 1:

a=4, b=6 (even to even):

sum should be f(3) (since a is even → no contribution from a. b is even → contribute floor(6/2)=3.

Yes, which matches the previous example.

Example 2:

a=5 (odd), b=7 (odd):

sum should be f(2) (a is odd → floor(5/2)=2) and b is odd → no contribution. So sum is f(2) mod 2. Which matches the example.

Another example: a=5, b=8 (even):

sum is f(2) (a is odd) + f(4) (b is even) mod 2. Which matches the previous example where sum was f(2)+f(4) mod 2.

So this seems to work.

So the formula for sum_{i=a}^b f( floor(i/2) ) mod 2 is:

sum = 0

if a is odd:

sum += f( floor(a/2) )

if b is even:

sum += f( floor(b/2) )

sum %= 2

This is a crucial insight. So the sum over the interval [a, b] is the sum of f(k) for the starting odd a and ending even b, if they exist.

So this allows us to compute the sum for any interval [a, b] in O(1) recursive calls (assuming we can compute f(k) for those k's).

So now, putting this together, to compute f(x), the sum up to x mod 2:

If x <=n: return precomputed sum up to x mod 2.

Else:

sum = sum_initial (sum up to n mod 2)

sum += sum_{i=n+1}^x a_i mod 2

But each a_i is f( floor(i/2) mod 2.

So sum_{i=n+1}^x a_i mod 2 is equal to sum_{i=n+1}^x f( floor(i/2) ) mod 2.

Using the formula above, this sum is:

sum_part = 0

if (n+1) is odd → add f( floor( (n+1)/2 )

if x is even → add f( floor( x/2 ) )

sum_part = (sum_part) mod 2

So sum_initial + sum_part mod 2.

Wait, no: the sum_{i=n+1}^x a_i mod 2 is equal to the sum_part computed for the interval [n+1, x]. So using the formula, sum_part is:

start = n+1

end = x

sum_part = 0

if start <= end:

    if start is odd:

        sum_part += f( floor(start/2) )

    if end is even:

        sum_part += f( floor(end/2) )

sum_part %= 2

Then, sum_initial (sum up to n) + sum_part mod 2.

But this is the formula for sum_part.

So the recursive function for f(x) is:

def f(x):

    if x ==0:

        return 0

    if x <=n:

        return prefix[x]  # precomputed sum up to x mod 2

    if x in memo:

        return memo[x]

    # compute sum from 1 to x mod 2

    sum_initial = prefix[n]

    # compute sum_part: sum_{i=n+1}^x a_i mod 2

    # which is sum_{i=n+1}^x f( floor(i/2) ) mod 2

    a = n+1

    b = x

    sum_part = 0

    if a <= b:

        # compute the sum_part using the formula

        if a % 2 ==1:

            sum_part += f( (a-1)//2 )

        if b %2 ==0:

            sum_part += f( b//2 )

        sum_part %=2

    total = (sum_initial + sum_part) %2

    memo[x] = total

    return total

So this is a recursive function that uses memoization. But since x can be up to 1e18, memoizing all possible x is not feasible. However, the function f(x) will compute f(x) by recursing to f(k), where k is up to x/2. Each step reduces x by a factor of at least 2, so the depth is O(log x). For each query, the number of recursive calls is O(log x), which is acceptable for 1e4 queries.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute the prefix sum array for the first n elements modulo 2.

2. For each query m:

   a. If m <=n, output a[m-1].

   b. Else, compute f( floor(m/2) ) mod 2. This is a_m.

But wait, a_m is S(k) mod 2, where k=floor(m/2). So a_m = f(k) mod 2.

So the steps for a query m:

Compute k = m//2

if k ==0:

    a_m = 0

else:

    a_m = f(k) % 2

But wait, the definition says a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements. Which is equivalent to the sum of the first floor(m/2) elements mod 2. So yes, a_m is f(k) mod 2, where k= floor(m/2).

So for m>n, a_m is f( floor(m/2) ) mod 2.

But f(k) is the sum up to k mod 2, so this is correct.

So, the algorithm for a query m is:

if m <=n:

    return a[m-1]

else:

    k = floor(m/2)

    compute f(k) mod 2 → this is a_m.

So the problem reduces to computing f(k), which is handled by the recursive function above.

Now, let's implement this. Since we can't use recursion for large x (stack overflow), we can implement it iteratively, or use memoization with a dictionary. But given that for each query, the number of function calls is O(log m), and with t=1e4 and log m=60, the total number of function calls is 6e5, which is manageable.

But using memoization with a cache (like a dictionary) would help avoid redundant calculations. However, for Python, with a dictionary, even 1e6 entries are manageable.

So, the steps for implementation:

For each test case:

- Read n, l, r (but since l=r, it's m=l)

- Read the array a as a list of 0s and 1s.

- Precompute the prefix sum mod 2. For example, prefix[x] = sum(a[0..x-1}) mod 2. (assuming 0-based, since the first x elements are a_1 to a_x.)

Wait, the prefix sum should be cumulative. Let's think:

prefix[0] = 0 (sum of 0 elements)

prefix[1] = a[0] mod 2

prefix[2] = (a[0] + a[1}) mod 2

and so on up to prefix[n] = sum(a[0]..a[n-1}) mod 2.

So for x in 0..n, prefix[x] is the sum of the first x elements.

Then, the function f(x) for x <=n is prefix[x].

For x >n, f(x) is computed as described.

So, code steps:

For each test case:

Compute prefix as a list where prefix[i] is sum of first i elements mod 2.

Read m.

if m <=n:

    output a[m-1]

else:

    k = m //2

    compute f(k) as per the recursive function, then mod 2.

    output that value.

Now, implementing the function f(k):

Implement a memoization cache (like a dictionary) for each test case. Wait, but memoization can be shared across test cases? No, because each test case has different prefix values. So the memoization must be per test case.

But since each test case is processed separately, and memo is cleared after each test case, this is manageable.

Alternatively, during the computation of f(k) for a test case, we can memoize the results in a dictionary that's local to the test case.

But with m up to 1e18, the number of unique k's processed per test case is O(log m), which is manageable.

So the code can be structured as follows:

For each test case:

    Read n, l, r (m = l)

    Read a list.

    Compute prefix array.

    if m <=n:

        print(a[m-1])

        continue

    else:

        k = m //2

        Now compute f(k)

        To compute f(k):

            Use a memoization dictionary.

            Implement the function as a helper with memo.

        Then, a_m is f(k) % 2.

        print(a_m)

But how to implement this helper function?

In Python, we can use a memoization decorator with a per-test-case cache, but since each test case is processed separately, it's better to handle it with a separate cache each time.

Alternatively, we can use a recursive function with a memoization dictionary passed as an argument.

But recursion depth may be an issue. For example, m is 1e18, and each step halves the value, so the recursion depth is log2(1e18) ≈ 60 levels. Python's default recursion depth is higher than that (like 1000), so recursion should be safe.

But perhaps it's better to implement it iteratively to avoid stack overflow.

Alternative approach: use memoization with a dictionary and compute f(k) iteratively.

But for now, let's proceed with the recursive approach.

So, in code:

def compute_f(x, n, prefix, memo):

    if x in memo:

        return memo[x]

    if x <=n:

        return prefix[x]

    sum_initial = prefix[n]

    a = n+1

    b = x

    sum_part = 0

    if a <=b:

        # compute sum_part

        start = a

        end = b

        if start %2 ==1:

            k_start = (start -1)//2

            sum_part += compute_f(k_start, n, prefix, memo)

        if end %2 ==0:

            k_end = end //2

            sum_part += compute_f(k_end, n, prefix, memo)

        sum_part %=2

    total = (sum_initial + sum_part) %2

    memo[x] = total

    return total

Then, for each test case:

n, l, r = map(int, ...)

m = l

a = list(map(int, ...))

prefix = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):

    prefix[i] = (prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]) %2

if m <=n:

    print(a[m-1])

else:

    k = m //2

    memo = {}

    res = compute_f(k, n, prefix, memo)

    print(res %2)

Wait, but compute_f returns the sum up to x mod 2, so res is already mod 2. So a_m is res.

Yes. Because a_m is the sum up to k mod 2, which is compute_f(k, ...) mod 2. But compute_f returns sum mod 2, so a_m is res.

So code can be:

print(res)

Testing this with the first sample:

Sample 1:

Input:

1

1 1 1

1

n=1, m=1.

m <=n → output a[0] → 1.

Sample 2:

Test case 2:

n=2, l=r=3.

a is [1,0]

m=3>2.

k=3//2=1.

compute_f(1, ...)

since 1 <=2, return prefix[1] which is a[0] → 1.

So a_3 is 1.

Sample output is 1.

Which matches the demo.

Another test case from demo:

Test case 3:

n=3, l=r=5.

a is [1,1,1]

m=5>3.

k=5//2=2.

compute_f(2, n=3, prefix is [0,1, 0, 1+1=2 mod2=0? Let's see:

prefix[0] =0

prefix[1] =a[0] =1

prefix[2] =1 +a[1] =1+1=2 mod2=0.

prefix[3] =0 +a[2] =0+1=1.

So compute_f(2) returns prefix[2] =0. So a_5=0.

Which matches the third demo output.

So the code seems correct.

Now, for the test case where m=1e18, this code should compute f(5e17), which in turn will compute other values recursively.

But with memoization, each function call for a new x is computed once.

The code's time complexity per test case is O(log m), which is acceptable.

So this should solve the problem.
