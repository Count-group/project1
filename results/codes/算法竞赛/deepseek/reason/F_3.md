Okay, let's try to figure out where the previous approach went wrong. The problem involves Alice and Bob playing optimally to maximize and minimize the final x value by choosing elements from the multiset. The key is determining the outcome for each bit position after all moves are made.

First, let's understand the problem again. Each element in the multiset is either 0 or a power of 2 (like 2^i). The players take turns picking elements. When they pick a number p, they can choose to XOR it with x or not. Then remove p from the multiset. Alice wants x to be as large as possible, Bob as small as possible.

The initial approach considered the parity of the sum of higher bits and the zeros. But maybe the handling of zeros wasn't correct. Zeros can affect the parity of the number of moves before processing a particular bit. For example, each zero is a move where the player can choose to flip x or not, but since XOR with 0 does nothing, the player's choice here is irrelevant. However, the presence of zeros affects the turn order for subsequent bits.

Wait, zeros are elements in the multiset. So when a player picks a zero, they can choose to XOR x with 0 (which doesn't change x) and then remove the zero. But since this doesn't affect x, the players would want to manage these moves to control the turn order for subsequent bits. However, because the player can choose whether to XOR (though it's a no-op), but the outcome is the same either way. So when a zero is picked, the player's choice has no effect on x. Therefore, the only impact of a zero is on the turn order for the remaining elements.

But how do zeros affect the parity of the number of moves before a certain bit is processed? Let's think: the total number of elements is sum(b_i) + z. The processing order is such that players take turns. The starting player for a bit depends on the parity of the number of elements processed before that bit.

Wait, the order in which elements are processed matters. But the players are trying to optimize x. The optimal strategy is to process the highest bits first, as those have the most significant impact. So for each bit position i (from highest to lowest), the players will process all elements of 2^i before moving to lower bits. However, zeros can be processed at any time, but since they don't affect x, the players would process them in a way that controls the turn order for the higher bits.

Hmm, maybe the zeros should be considered as part of the total elements processed, but since they don't affect x, the key is how their parity (even or odd) affects the starting player for the higher bits.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first process all non-zero elements (bits), then the zeros. But players can choose to process zeros in between. However, since the players are optimal, they will process the zeros in a way that gives them the best advantage for the remaining bits.

Alternatively, the zeros can be thought of as being used to control the parity of the total moves before processing each bit. For example, the starting player for a bit depends on how many moves have been made before that bit is processed. If there are z zeros, those can be interleaved with the processing of the bits, affecting the parity.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of game theory. Each non-zero element (bit) contributes to the outcome of x based on how many times it's taken, and whether the starting player (Alice or Bob) can control the parity of the count.

For each bit i (2^i), there are b_i elements. Each time a player takes one of these elements, they can choose to flip the bit in x or not. Since the players are optimal, they will make choices that lead to the best possible outcome.

Wait, when a player takes a bit 2^i, they can choose to XOR it (which flips the i-th bit) or not. The optimal play here would be to decide whether flipping this bit would be beneficial given the current state of x and the remaining game.

But given that the game is played optimally, perhaps the outcome for each bit can be determined independently, considering the parity of the count of elements and the starting player's turn.

Wait, here's a key insight: For each bit position i, the outcome (whether the bit is set in x) depends on whether the number of times the bit is flipped is odd or even. Each element of 2^i can be taken, and each time it's taken, the player can choose to flip the bit. But since the players are trying to maximize/minimize x, they will flip the bit if it's beneficial for their goal.

But when considering the optimal play, for each bit, the players will arrange to have the maximum possible impact. Let's model the decision for each bit.

Let's suppose that for a bit i, there are m elements (b_i). The players will process these m elements. For each element, the player can choose to flip the bit or not. However, since the players are acting optimally, they will choose to flip the bit in a way that maximizes their own objective.

But since the players alternate turns, the outcome will depend on the number of elements (m) and the starting player.

Wait, perhaps the parity of m (even or odd) determines the outcome. For example, if there are an even number of elements, then each player can cancel out the other's moves. But if it's odd, the starting player can set the bit.

But Alice and Bob have conflicting goals. Let's think for a single bit scenario. Suppose there is 1 element (m=1) of 2^i, and the starting player is Alice. She can choose to flip the bit (since she wants to maximize x). So the bit will be set. If the starting player is Bob and m=1, Bob would choose not to flip, to minimize x.

Wait, that's a possible approach. Let's think of each bit as a separate game, where the outcome depends on the number of elements (m) and the starting player (turn).

But how do the zeros affect the starting player for each bit? Because zeros are elements that can be processed first, and each zero is a move, which changes the turn.

Suppose we process the bits in order from highest to lowest. For each bit i, the starting player is determined by the number of moves made before processing this bit. The number of moves before processing bit i is the sum of elements in higher bits (since they are processed first) plus the number of zeros processed before.

But the players can choose when to process the zeros. However, since zeros don't affect x, the optimal play would process zeros in a way that gives them the best possible starting player for the remaining bits.

Wait, but zeros can be processed at any time. So Alice and Bob can choose to process some zeros before a bit i to change the starting player's parity for that bit. But how to model this?

An alternative approach is to model the parity of the total number of elements (non-zero and zeros) processed before each bit. Since the order can be chosen by the players to optimize their goals, we need to find the optimal parity for each bit.

But how?

Let me think. Let's process the bits in order from highest to lowest. For each bit i, the number of non-zero elements in higher bits is sum_{j>i} b_j. The zeros can be processed either before or after processing the higher bits. The players will choose to process zeros in such a way that the parity (even or odd) of the total moves before processing bit i (sum_higher + processed_zeros) is as favorable as possible for their strategy.

But since Alice starts first, she would want to set the parity in a way that benefits her for each bit. Similarly, Bob would try to counter.

Wait, but how do the zeros affect the parity for each bit? The total number of moves before processing bit i is sum_higher (number of higher non-zero elements) plus the number of zeros processed before that bit. The parity of this sum determines the starting player for bit i.

The players can choose how many zeros to process before each bit. However, once a zero is processed, it's removed from the multiset. So the decision is how to interleave the processing of zeros and bits to control the starting player parity for each bit.

But given that the players are trying to maximize/minimize x, they will choose the order that benefits their goal the most.

This is getting quite complicated. Let's try to model it step by step.

First, process the highest bit first. The starting player is Alice. The number of elements for this bit is b_i. How is the outcome determined?

For each element in b_i, the current player can choose to flip the bit or not. But since the players are optimal, they will flip it if it benefits their goal. For example, if the bit is 0 and the player wants to maximize x, they will flip it (if possible). However, this depends on the current state of the bit and the players' strategies.

But perhaps for each bit, the outcome depends on whether the count of elements (b_i) is even or odd, and who starts first.

Wait, let's think for a bit i. Suppose the starting player is Alice.

If there are m elements (b_i) in the set for this bit.

If m is even: Alice and Bob will alternate taking elements. Each time a player takes an element, they can choose to flip the bit. But since m is even, each player takes an equal number of elements. The optimal play would result in the bit being flipped even times, which leaves it as 0. Because each player can choose to flip the bit in a way that cancels the other's action. For example, Alice flips, Bob flips, etc. So the outcome is 0.

If m is odd: The starting player (Alice) can flip the bit once (since after all, the remaining even elements can be canceled out by Bob). So the bit will be 1.

But wait, this depends on whether the starting player can force the bit to be 1. For example, if m is 3 (odd), Alice takes first, chooses to flip. Then Bob takes the next, can choose to flip again. Then Alice takes the third, flips again. So overall, the bit is flipped 3 times, which is odd, resulting in 1. So if m is odd, the outcome is 1 if starting player is Alice, and 0 if starting player is Bob?

Wait, perhaps the outcome for a bit i is determined by whether the number of elements (b_i) is even or odd, and the starting player's parity (even or odd).

So for a bit i with count m:

If m is even: the outcome is 0, since each flip cancels out.

If m is odd: outcome is 1 if the starting player is Alice (since she can flip once and the rest even flips are canceled), or 0 if the starting player is Bob (he can avoid flipping).

Wait, but this depends on how the players choose to flip. For example, when m is odd and starting player is Alice:

- Alice takes first. She can choose to flip (to set the bit to 1). Then Bob takes the next, he will choose not to flip (to keep it at 1?), because he wants to minimize x. Wait, no. Bob wants to minimize x, so if the bit is 1 after Alice's move, Bob would want to flip it to 0 if possible.

Wait, perhaps the outcome for m elements and starting player is determined by the parity of m and the starting player's turn.

Wait, let's model it as follows:

The starting player can decide the outcome if m is odd. Because after m-1 elements (even), the outcome is determined by the first player's decision.

For example:

m=1 (odd):

Starting player (Alice) can choose to flip the bit (resulting in 1), which is better for her. So outcome is 1.

m=3 (odd):

Players take turns. Alice flips (1), Bob flips (0), Alice flips (1). Total flips 3: outcome is 1.

If starting player is Bob, and m=3:

Bob would flip (0), Alice flips (1), Bob flips (0). Outcome is 0.

Wait, no. Wait, if Bob starts, and wants to minimize x. So for m=1, Bob would not flip, so outcome is 0. For m=3, Bob flips (0), Alice flips (1), Bob flips (0). Outcome is 0.

Wait, this seems to suggest that when m is odd, the outcome is determined by the starting player. If the starting player is Alice (maximizer), outcome is 1. If starting player is Bob (minimizer), outcome is 0.

But how to model the starting player for each bit?

The starting player for each bit depends on the parity of the total number of elements processed before this bit. If the total is even, Alice starts; if odd, Bob starts.

The elements processed before this bit include all higher bits (since we process from highest to lowest) and any zeros processed before this bit.

But zeros can be processed in any order. The players will choose to process zeros in a way that sets the parity of the starting player for each bit to their advantage.

The problem is to determine how many zeros are processed before each bit to achieve the best possible outcome.

But since zeros can be processed in any order, the players will choose the optimal number of zeros to process before each bit to maximize their advantage.

But how to model this optimally?

The key idea is that the players can use the zeros to control the parity of the starting player for each bit. For each bit, after processing higher bits and some zeros, the parity of the starting player is determined.

The players can choose to process zeros before processing a bit to change the starting player's parity. Since zeros don't affect x, their only role is to change the turn order.

The players' strategy will be to process as many zeros as needed before a bit to set the starting parity to the best possible for that bit.

But how?

Let me think. Suppose after processing all higher bits, the total number of elements processed (sum of higher bits and any zeros processed up to that point) is T. The starting player for the current bit is determined by T % 2 (0: Alice, 1: Bob).

The players can choose to process some zeros before the current bit to adjust T's parity.

But since the players are optimal, they will choose to process an even or odd number of zeros to set the parity that benefits them most for the current bit.

For example, consider a current bit i. The players can choose to process 0 or 1 zeros (mod 2) before processing this bit to set the starting parity.

But since there are z zeros available, they can choose to use any number (as long as they don't exceed z), but after using a zero, it's removed from the multiset.

But how to model this optimally?

Perhaps for each bit, after processing the higher bits and using some zeros, the optimal parity for the starting player can be determined based on the current bit's count (even or odd).

Let's formalize this.

For each bit i (processed in order from highest to lowest):

Let sum_higher be the sum of elements in higher bits (already processed).

Let available_zeros be the number of zeros remaining.

The parity of sum_higher plus the number of zeros processed before this bit will determine the starting player.

The players can choose to process a certain number of zeros (0 or 1, modulo 2) to adjust the starting parity.

The choice depends on whether processing an even or odd number of zeros before this bit would give the optimal outcome for the bit.

For example, if after processing higher bits, sum_higher is even:

- If the current bit's count (b_i) is even: the outcome is 0, regardless of starting parity. So no need to adjust zeros.

- If the current bit's count is odd: outcome depends on starting parity. So the players would want to adjust the parity to get the best possible outcome.

But since Alice and Bob are adversaries, they will choose the parity that benefits their goal.

But how?

The key is to determine for each bit, given the sum of higher bits and the available zeros, what is the optimal starting parity.

Let me think again.

For each bit i:

sum_higher_processed = sum of elements in higher bits (already processed)

available_zeros = z_remaining (zeros left)

The starting parity for bit i is (sum_higher_processed + processed_zeros_before_i) % 2.

The players can choose processed_zeros_before_i (mod 2) by choosing to process an even or odd number of zeros (up to available_zeros) before this bit.

Alice wants to choose the parity that maximizes the outcome for this bit, and Bob wants to minimize it.

But how to model this choice?

Let's consider that the players will choose the parity that is best for the current bit's outcome.

For bit i:

If the count of elements (b_i) is even:

- Then regardless of the starting parity, the outcome is 0. Because even number of elements, starting player's choices cancel out.

So the players can choose any parity, but the outcome is 0.

Thus, the parity of processed_zeros_before_i doesn't matter. They can use any number of zeros (even or odd), but the outcome is 0.

If the count of elements (b_i) is odd:

- Then the outcome is 1 if the starting player is Alice (even parity), 0 if the starting player is Bob (odd parity).

So for this bit, the outcome depends on the starting parity. The players will want to set the starting parity to their advantage.

But Alice and Bob are adversaries. For this bit, Alice wants the outcome to be 1, and Bob wants it to be 0.

Thus, for this bit, the starting parity should be even (Alice's turn) if possible.

But how do the players control the starting parity using zeros?

The starting parity is determined by (sum_higher_processed + processed_zeros_before_i) % 2.

The players can choose to add 0 or 1 to this sum (mod 2) by processing an even or odd number of zeros before this bit.

But since they are playing optimally, Alice will choose to add a number of zeros (even or odd) to make the parity even (if possible), and Bob will try to make it odd.

Wait, but after processing higher bits, the sum_higher_processed is fixed. So the initial parity is (sum_higher_processed) % 2. Then, the players can choose to add processed_zeros_before_i (0 or 1) to adjust the parity.

But since they have to process the zeros in the order of their choosing, the players will choose whether to process an even or odd number of zeros before processing this bit.

But since the zeros are processed between higher bits and this bit, the players can choose how many to process here, up to the available count.

But how do they decide?

This seems like a classic game theory problem where each bit's outcome depends on the available zeros and the current players' choices.

Let me model this recursively.

For each bit i, after processing higher bits, we have:

- sum_higher_processed: the sum of higher bits processed.

- available_zeros: the number of zeros left.

We need to compute the maximum possible outcome for the remaining bits (including i) given that the players are acting optimally.

But this approach is not feasible for large k and z (up to 1e9), as the recursion would be too slow.

So we need a greedy approach.

Another key observation: the optimal play for each bit depends on the parity of sum_higher_processed + available_zeros_used_before.

But how?

Alternatively, the parity of the total number of elements processed before this bit (sum_higher + zeros_used_before) will determine the starting player.

But since the zeros can be used to adjust this parity, the optimal choice is to use as many zeros as needed (even or odd) to set the parity to the best possible for the current bit.

However, the players are constrained by the available zeros. For example, if there are zero zeros left, they can't adjust the parity.

But since zeros can be used in any order, the players can choose to use an even or odd number of zeros (as long as the available_zeros allows) to set the parity.

Let's think of it this way: the parity of the starting player for bit i is (sum_higher_processed + used_zeros) % 2.

But used_zeros can be chosen as 0 or 1 (mod 2), provided that there are enough zeros.

The players will choose used_zeros (mod 2) such that the outcome for the bit is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob.

So for bit i with count b_i:

If b_i is even: outcome is 0, so the players don't care about the starting parity. So they can use any even or odd number of zeros here, but it's irrelevant. So the used_zeros can be 0 or 1, but the outcome is 0. So the total sum_higher_processed_so_far becomes sum_higher_processed + used_zeros + b_i.

But since the outcome is 0, the sum_higher_processed_so_far increases by used_zeros + b_i.

Wait, but sum_higher_processed_so_far is the cumulative sum of all elements processed up to but not including the current bit.

Wait, perhaps the sum_higher_processed_so_far is the sum of higher bits and any zeros used before processing the current bit.

For the current bit i, after processing higher bits and some zeros, the sum is sum_higher_processed_so_far = sum_higher + used_zeros_before_i.

Then, the starting parity is sum_higher_processed_so_far % 2.

When processing the current bit, the players take b_i elements. The outcome is determined by whether b_i is even or odd and the starting parity.

After processing the current bit, the sum_higher_processed_so_far increases by b_i.

Then, the remaining available zeros is z_remaining = available_zeros_initial - used_zeros_before_i.

But how to model this in code?

Alternatively, for each bit i (processed from highest to lowest):

1. Determine the current sum of higher bits processed (sum_higher).

2. The players can choose to use some zeros (even or odd) before processing this bit to adjust the starting parity.

3. The starting parity after using these zeros is (sum_higher + used_zeros) % 2.

4. Determine the outcome for the current bit based on b_i and starting parity.

5. Update sum_higher to sum_higher + used_zeros + b_i.

6. The remaining zeros are z -= used_zeros.

But how to compute used_zeros optimally?

The key is that the players can choose to use any number of zeros (even or odd), but the optimal choice depends on the current bit's outcome.

For each bit i:

If b_i is even:

- The outcome is 0, so the players don't care about the starting parity. They can choose to use even or odd zeros, but the choice affects the starting parity of the next bits. However, since the current bit's outcome is fixed, the players will choose the option that optimizes the remaining bits.

But since the current bit's outcome is 0, the players will choose the used_zeros parity that gives the best possible starting parity for the next bits.

But this is a recursive problem, and we need a way to model it greedily.

Alternatively, since we process bits from highest to lowest, and each bit's choice of zeros affects the starting parity of the next bits, but not the current one, perhaps we can model this by keeping track of the parity of the sum_higher plus the used_zeros.

But this is getting quite complicated.

Let's look back at the sample input.

Sample Input:

2 0

2 1

Sample Output:

11

Which is 3 in binary.

The bits are for 2^1 and 2^0.

So k=2, so the bits are 0 and 1 (since the indices are 0-based? Or 1-based? Wait, the problem says "the next line contains k integers, the i-th integer is b_{i-1}". So for k=2, the input is two integers: b_0 (2^0) and b_1 (2^1). But the sample input is given as 2 1, meaning b_0 is 2 (bit 0), b_1 is 1 (bit 1). Wait, no: the second line is the i-th integer is b_{i-1}, so for i=1, it's b_0 (bit 0), for i=2, it's b_1 (bit 1). So the sample input has:

b_0 = 2, b_1 = 1.

So the multiset has two 1s (2^0) and one 2 (2^1), and zero zeros.

Now, the initial x is not given. Wait, the problem statement says that x is a single integer. Oh, the problem says "a single integer x" before the game. But what is the initial value of x? The problem says to output the final x. But in the problem statement, the initial x is part of the input? Wait, no: the problem statement says "the final value of x". But the problem's input does not include x. Wait, looking back:

Problem Input:

The first line has k and z.

The next line has k integers, the i-th is b_{i-1} (for 0<=i<k).

So the initial x is not given. Wait, but how is that possible? The problem must have a fixed initial x. Or perhaps the initial x is zero. Because the problem says that each number in a is 0 or 2^i before the game. But the initial x is part of the input? Or is it part of the problem's setup?

Wait, the problem statement says:

"In front of them are a multiset {a_i} of non-negative integers and a single integer x."

Ah, so the initial x is part of the game setup. But the input does not specify x. So the problem must have an initial x of zero, or it's given as part of the input. But looking at the input specification:

The input is:

k and z.

Then, the next line is k integers, b_0 to b_{k-1}.

So the initial x is not given as input. This is confusing. Wait, the problem statement says "each number in a is 0 or 2^i (0 <=i <k) before the game". So the multiset a consists of some zeros and some powers of two. The x is a single integer that is part of the initial setup, but the problem's input does not include it. Wait, but the output is to compute the final x after all moves. So perhaps the initial x is zero. Or maybe the problem is missing some information. Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement.

Wait, the problem statement says:

"In one person's turn, he or she will choose an integer from a. Let this number be p. Then this person will choose whether or not to make x <- x XOR p, then remove p from a."

The initial x must be part of the input. But the problem's input does not include x. So there's a mistake here. But the sample input has k=2, z=0, and b_0=2, b_1=1. The sample output is 11 (binary), which is 3. The initial x must be zero. Because 2^1 (2) is in the multiset once, and 2^0 (1) is in twice.

Let's see how the sample works.

Sample Input:

k=2, z=0 (no zeros).

Bits:

bit 1 (2^1) has count 1.

bit 0 (2^0) has count 2.

Processing bits from highest to lowest (bit 1 first).

Bit 1: count is 1 (odd).

Starting player is Alice (since sum of higher bits is zero, parity is even).

Since the count is odd, Alice can choose to flip the bit. So x becomes 2 (binary 10).

Then, process bit 0: count is 2 (even).

The sum of higher bits processed is 1 (bit 1) and zero zeros, so parity is 1. Starting player is Bob.

For even count, the outcome is 0. So the bit 0 remains as 0.

Wait, but the final x is 2, which is binary 10, but the sample output is 11 (3).

Hmm, that contradicts the sample. So my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, the sample output is 11, which is 3 (binary). So both bits are set.

So how does that happen?

Let's re-examine the sample.

Multiset has two 1s (bit 0) and one 2 (bit 1).

The initial x is 0.

Players take turns.

Alice's goal is to maximize x.

Bob's goal is to minimize it.

The game is as follows:

The elements are 2, 1, 1.

But the order of play is chosen by the players. The players will pick elements in the order that maximizes their objectives.

But since the players are optimal, they will process the highest bits first.

So the first element picked is 2 (bit 1).

Alice picks 2. She can choose to XOR x (0) with 2, making x=2. Then remove 2 from the set.

Next, the elements are 1, 1.

Bob's turn. He picks one of the 1s. He wants to minimize x. Since x is 2 (binary 10), Bob can choose to XOR it with 1, making x=3 (binary 11), which is worse for him. Or he can choose not to XOR, leaving x as 2. So Bob will choose not to XOR. So x remains 2. Then he removes the 1.

Alice's turn. She picks the remaining 1. She can choose to XOR x (2) with 1, making x=3. She does this to maximize x. Then removes the 1.

So the final x is 3 (binary 11), which matches the sample.

So how does this relate to the earlier analysis?

The key is that for the bit 1, the count is 1 (odd), and the starting player is Alice. So the outcome is 1.

For bit 0, the count is 2 (even), but the starting player is Bob (since sum of higher bits (1) plus zeros (0) is 1, which is odd). So Bob starts. But with even count, the outcome is 0. But in the actual game, Alice managed to flip one of the two bits, leading to an overall flip.

Wait, this suggests that the earlier model is incorrect.

So what's the correct way to model this?

Perhaps the earlier model is missing that even counts can have non-zero outcomes based on the players' choices.

Alternative approach:

For each element in the bit i's count, the players can choose to flip the bit or not, based on their strategy.

For each bit i, the players take turns selecting elements. Each time a player selects an element of bit i, they can choose to flip x's bit i. The players' choices depend on their goals.

The outcome for bit i is the parity of the number of times it was flipped (even: 0, odd: 1).

But the players will choose to flip or not based on their goals.

The key is to determine how many times the bit will be flipped, which is the number of elements chosen to be flipped (each player chooses whether to flip when they take an element).

For example, for a bit i with count m:

If m is even:

- Each player can alternate flipping, leading to even total flips (outcome 0).

If m is odd:

- The first player can flip once, and the remaining even flips cancel out (outcome 1).

But this depends on the starting player.

But how do the players decide whether to flip or not?

In the case of even m:

- If the starting player is Alice (maximizer), she wants to flip the bit if it's currently 0, and not flip if it's 1. Similarly for Bob (minimizer).

But the players' choices may depend on the current state of x. However, since the bits are processed from highest to lowest, the lower bits are processed after the higher ones. So the state of lower bits can be considered as 0 initially, and their processing doesn't affect higher bits.

This suggests that each bit can be processed independently, based on the starting player's turn and the count of elements.

So, for each bit i:

- The outcome is 1 if the number of flips is odd, 0 otherwise.

- The number of flips is determined by how many times the players choose to flip when taking the element.

The players will choose to flip or not in a way that maximizes their own objectives.

But since the bit is initially 0 (assuming higher bits are processed first), the starting player's choice for each element will depend on their goals.

For example:

If the bit is 0, and the current player is Alice (maximizer), she will choose to flip it to 1. If the current player is Bob (minimizer), he will choose not to flip, leaving it 0.

But if the bit is 1, Alice would not flip (to keep it 1), and Bob would flip to 0.

But since the bit is processed in order, the initial state is 0.

Thus, for each element in the bit's count:

- If the player is Alice and the bit is 0, she will flip to 1.

- If the player is Bob and the bit is 0, he will not flip.

But once the bit is flipped to 1, subsequent players will have different options.

However, this complicates the model, as the state of the bit can change during processing.

But since the players are processing the elements of a single bit in sequence, and each player's choice to flip or not depends on the current state of the bit, the outcome depends on the order of turns and the number of elements.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a pattern.

Let's model the processing of a single bit i with m elements.

The initial state of the bit is 0.

The players alternate turns, taking elements in order.

For each element taken, the player can choose to flip the bit or not.

The players choose optimally to maximize/minimize the final bit.

For example:

Case m=1:

Alice's turn. She can flip to 1. Outcome is 1.

Case m=2:

Alice takes first. She flips to 1.

Bob takes second. He can flip to 0. So outcome is 0.

But Bob's goal is to minimize x. So he would choose to flip.

Alternatively, if Alice's flip makes it 1, Bob's flip brings it back to 0.

Thus, even m=2 leads to outcome 0.

Case m=3:

Alice flips to 1.

Bob flips to 0.

Alice flips to 1. Outcome is 1.

So for m odd: outcome is 1 if Alice starts, 0 if Bob starts.

For m even: outcome is 0.

But wait, in the sample input, for bit 0 (count=2), m is even. So the outcome is 0. But in the sample, the outcome is 1. This suggests that the model is incorrect.

Wait, in the sample, the bit 0 has count 2, which is even. According to the model, the outcome should be 0. But in the actual game, Alice managed to flip it once, leading to outcome 1.

Hmm, this indicates that the model is not correct.

So what's the error in the model?

In the sample, after processing the bit 1 (count 1), the players processed the two elements of bit 0.

Alice's turn: she takes the first 1. She flips x's bit 0 from 0 to 1.

Bob's turn: he takes the second 1. He can choose to flip it back to 0 (to minimize x). But he doesn't, leaving it at 1.

Wait, why would Bob choose not to flip?

Because after his move, the x is 2 (bit 1 is 1, bit 0 is 0). But after his move, if he flips the bit 0, x becomes 3 (binary 11), which is worse for him. So he chooses not to flip.

Ah! So the players' choices depend not only on the current bit but also on the higher bits that have already been processed.

This complicates things because the decision to flip a lower bit depends on the state of higher bits.

Thus, the model that processes each bit independently is incorrect.

This means that the players' decisions for a lower bit (e.g., bit 0) are influenced by the state of higher bits (bit 1), and thus the processing order and interleaving of flips becomes crucial.

Thus, the earlier approach of processing each bit independently is insufficient.

This suggests that the correct approach must consider the current state of x when processing each bit.

But how can we model this efficiently?

Alternative idea: The outcome for each bit depends on the number of elements (even or odd) and the parity of the starting player. However, the starting player's parity is determined by the sum of all elements processed before (including higher bits and zeros) modulo 2.

But when processing a bit, the players' choices are influenced by the current state of x's higher bits.

For example, when processing bit 0, the higher bits (like bit 1) are already set. So flipping bit 0 may increase or decrease x based on the higher bits.

Thus, the decision to flip a bit depends on the current state of higher bits.

But this seems very complex. How can we model this in code?

Let's think again about the sample:

After processing bit 1 (count 1), x is 2 (10 in binary).

Processing bit 0 (count 2):

First element: Alice's turn. She can choose to flip bit 0. Current x is 10. Flipping makes it 11 (3), which is better for her. So she flips.

Second element: Bob's turn. Current x is 11. Flipping bit 0 would make it 10 (2), which is better for him. So he flips.

Thus, the final x is 10, which is 2. But the sample output is 11. So this contradicts.

Wait, this suggests that my previous analysis of the sample is wrong. How did the sample reach 11?

In the actual game:

Players process the elements in the order of highest bits first.

Elements are 2, 1, 1.

Alice's first turn: picks 2. She chooses to flip x (0) to 2. x becomes 2.

Bob's turn: picks 1. He can choose to flip bit 0. Current x is 10. If he flips, x becomes 11. But he wants to minimize x. So he would NOT flip, leaving x as 10.

Alice's turn: picks the last 1. She can choose to flip bit 0 to 1, making x 11.

Thus, the final x is 11.

So Bob, in his turn, did not flip the bit 0 because that would increase x. Thus, the model where the players decide to flip based on the current state of x is correct.

This shows that the decision to flip a bit depends on the current state of x. Thus, when a player chooses to flip a bit, they consider the current state of all higher bits.

Thus, the outcome for each bit is not independent of the higher bits. This complicates the matter.

But how to model this in code?

Let's think recursively. For each bit from highest to lowest:

- The current state of x's higher bits (bits > i) is already determined.

- The decision to flip bit i depends on the current state of higher bits.

For example, if higher bits are non-zero, flipping bit i may not change the higher bits but may affect the overall value of x.

But since we're processing bits from highest to lowest, once a bit is processed, the lower bits cannot affect it.

Thus, when processing bit i, the higher bits have already been processed, and their state is fixed.

Thus, the decision to flip bit i depends on whether the current x (considering higher bits) would be increased or decreased by flipping the i-th bit.

But how to model this?

Let's process each bit i from highest to lowest.

For each bit i:

- The current x's higher bits (bits > i) have been processed and are fixed.

- The current value of x's bit i is 0 (initially), but after processing, it may be 0 or 1.

- The players will process all elements of bit i, choosing whether to flip the bit each time.

The outcome for bit i depends on the number of flips (even/odd) and the players' choices.

But this depends on whether flipping the bit would increase or decrease x.

For example, if higher bits are non-zero:

- Flipping bit i will increase x if the current bit i is 0 (since 2^i added to x's current value). Or decrease if the current bit is 1.

But since the higher bits are fixed, flipping the i-th bit when the higher bits are non-zero can be determined based on whether adding 2^i increases or decreases x's overall value.

Wait, but x's value is a combination of all bits. However, once higher bits are processed, their values are fixed. So for bit i, the current x's higher bits are known.

For example, when processing bit i:

- Let x_high be the value of x from higher bits (bits > i). This is fixed.

- The value of x is x_high + current value of lower bits (bits <= i).

But since we process bits in order, the lower bits are yet to be processed, so their current value is 0.

Thus, when processing bit i, x_high is fixed, and the current x is x_high.

Flipping bit i will add 2^i to x_high (if the bit was 0) or subtract 2^i from x_high (if the bit was 1).

Thus, the decision to flip bit i depends on whether adding 2^i increases x (for Alice) or decreases it (for Bob).

But Alice and Bob will choose to flip the bit based on this.

For example, when processing bit i:

- The current x_high is known.

- Alice's turn: she will choose to flip the bit i if doing so increases x_high.

- Bob's turn: he will choose to flip the bit i if doing so decreases x_high.

But the players can choose to flip the bit each time they take an element of bit i.

However, since there are m elements (b_i) of bit i, the players will take turns choosing to flip the bit.

The key is to determine how many times the bit is flipped, based on the players' choices.

This can be modeled as follows:

For each bit i:

- The current x_high is fixed (from higher bits).

- The players take turns processing the m elements of bit i.

- For each element processed, the current player decides to flip the bit if it benefits their goal.

- The outcome for the bit is the parity of the number of flips (0 or 1).

But how to determine how many flips will occur?

Let's consider the impact of flipping the bit each time:

For each flip during processing of bit i:

- If the current x_high plus the current state of bit i is less than x_high + 2^i, then flipping (toggling the bit) would increase x (assuming the bit was 0 before the flip).

But once the bit is flipped to 1, subsequent flips would toggle it between 1 and 0.

But since the players process the elements in order, and the current state of the bit depends on previous flips.

This is complex, but let's consider the following:

The initial state of the bit is 0. Each flip toggles it.

For each of the m elements, the player can choose to flip the bit or not.

The players will choose to flip the bit if doing so improves their goal, given the current state.

Thus, for each element in the m elements:

- If it's Alice's turn:

   She will flip the bit if the current state of the bit is 0 (flipping increases x) or if the current state is 1 (flipping decreases x) but this is not beneficial. Wait, no. Alice wants to maximize x. So when she has the option to flip, she will do so if it increases x.

Similarly, Bob will flip if it decreases x.

But the current state of the bit depends on previous flips.

Let's model this for a single bit i:

Initial state: 0.

Players take turns processing m elements.

For each element:

1. Current state of bit i.

2. Player's turn: Alice or Bob.

3. Player decides whether to flip the bit.

Outcome: final state of the bit.

Let's simulate this for various m and starting player.

Example 1: m=1, starting player Alice.

Initial state: 0.

Alice's turn: flipping increases x (0 -> 1). She flips. Final state: 1.

Outcome: 1.

Example 2: m=1, starting player Bob.

Initial state: 0.

Bob's turn: flipping increases x. Bob wants to minimize x. So he will not flip. Final state: 0.

Outcome: 0.

Example 3: m=2, starting player Alice.

Turn 1: Alice flips (0 -> 1).

Turn 2: Bob's turn. Current state is 1. Flipping would decrease x (1 -> 0). Bob will flip. Final state: 0.

Outcome: 0.

Example 4: m=2, starting player Bob.

Turn 1: Bob's turn. Current state 0. Flipping increases x. Bob won't flip. State remains 0.

Turn 2: Alice's turn. Flipping increases x. She flips. State becomes 1.

Outcome: 1.

Example 5: m=3, starting player Alice.

Turn 1: Alice flips (0->1).

Turn 2: Bob flips (1->0).

Turn 3: Alice flips (0->1).

Outcome: 1.

Example 6: m=3, starting player Bob.

Turn 1: Bob's turn. State 0. He won't flip.

Turn 2: Alice's turn. Flips to 1.

Turn 3: Bob's turn. Flips to 0.

Outcome: 0.

This pattern shows that:

- If m is even:

   Outcome depends on starting player.

   If starting player is Alice:

      For m=2: outcome 0.

      For m=4: ?

   If starting player is Bob:

      For m=2: outcome 1.

- If m is odd:

   Outcome is 1 if starting player is Alice, else 0.

But wait, for m=2, starting player Bob:

Bob starts. He doesn't flip (state 0).

Alice flips (state 1).

Outcome is 1.

Which is odd, but m is even.

This suggests that when m is even, the outcome can be 1 if the starting player is Bob.

This contradicts the earlier model.

Thus, the outcome depends on m and the starting player, but not simply based on parity.

Thus, the model must be re-evaluated.

An alternative way to model this is to consider that for each element in the bit's count:

- If the current player can improve x by flipping the bit, they will do so.

- The optimal outcome is determined by the number of times the players can force a flip that benefits their goal.

But this requires considering the order of flips and the state changes.

But how to model this for large m (up to 1e9)?

A pattern emerges:

For even m:

- The players can alternate flipping the bit in a way that the outcome depends on the starting player's choice.

For example, if m is even and starting player is Alice:

- Alice flips (0->1).

- Bob flips (1->0).

- Alice flips (0->1).

- Bob flips (1->0).

And so on. The outcome depends on whether m/2 is even or odd.

Wait, for m=2:

Alice flips once, Bob flips once. Final state: 0.

For m=4:

Alice flips, Bob flips, Alice flips, Bob flips. Final state: 0.

For m=2k even, if starting with Alice, outcome is 0 if k is even, 0 if k is odd? No. For m=2, k=1: outcome is 0.

For m=4, k=2: outcome is 0.

Thus, for even m and starting player Alice, outcome is 0.

For even m and starting player Bob:

m=2, Bob starts. He doesn't flip (state 0).

Alice flips (state 1).

Bob doesn't flip (state 1 remains).

Alice flips (state 0).

Wait, for m=2, Bob starts:

- element 1: Bob's turn. He doesn't flip (state 0).

- element 2: Alice's turn. She flips (state 1).

Outcome is 1.

Thus, for even m and starting player Bob, outcome is 1 if m/2 is odd.

But this seems complicated. Perhaps the correct model is:

For each bit i:

- If m is even:

   The outcome is 1 if the starting player is Bob and m is even and m/2 is odd.

   Otherwise, outcome is 0.

But this is not general.

Alternative approach: For a bit i with m elements, starting player S (Alice or Bob), the outcome is:

- If m is even:

   The players will flip the bit an even number of times. But whether the final state is 0 or 1 depends on the starting player and the parity of m/2.

But this is unclear.

Alternatively, for even m:

The players will flip the bit m times if possible. But since they alternate, the number of flips depends on their choices.

But this seems intractable.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model each bit's outcome as follows:

- The outcome for a bit i is 1 if and only if the number of elements (m) is odd and the starting player is Alice, or the number of elements is even and the starting player is Bob and m is even.

But this is not correct based on the earlier examples.

Alternatively, the outcome for a bit i is determined by the following rules:

For each element in the bit's count:

- Alice will flip the bit if it's currently 0 (to maximize x).

- Bob will flip the bit if it's currently 1 (to minimize x).

This way, the players are making the best possible choice for their goal based on the current state of the bit.

Let's simulate this:

Case m=1, starting player Alice:

- Alice sees bit 0. She flips to 1. Outcome is 1.

Case m=1, starting player Bob:

- Bob sees bit 0. He doesn't flip. Outcome is 0.

Case m=2, starting player Alice:

- Element 1: Alice flips to 1.

- Element 2: Bob sees 1. He flips to 0.

Outcome 0.

Case m=2, starting player Bob:

- Element 1: Bob sees 0. He doesn't flip.

- Element 2: Alice sees 0. She flips to 1.

Outcome 1.

Case m=3, starting player Alice:

- Element 1: Alice flips to 1.

- Element 2: Bob flips to 0.

- Element 3: Alice flips to 1.

Outcome 1.

Case m=3, starting player Bob:

- Element 1: Bob doesn't flip.

- Element 2: Alice flips to 1.

- Element 3: Bob flips to 0.

Outcome 0.

Thus, the pattern is:

For bit i with m elements:

- If m is odd:

   outcome is 1 if starting player is Alice, else 0.

- If m is even:

   outcome is 1 if starting player is Bob, else 0.

Because for even m:

- Starting player Alice: even flips, ends up 0.

- Starting player Bob: Alice gets to flip once, Bob once, ends up 1.

Wait, for m=2 and starting player Bob:

Element 1: Bob doesn't flip.

Element 2: Alice flips.

Outcome is 1.

So for even m, the outcome is 1 if starting player is Bob, 0 if starting player is Alice.

Thus, the outcome for bit i is:

outcome = (m is odd and starting player is Alice) or (m is even and starting player is Bob).

Which can be written as:

outcome = (m % 2 == 1 and starting_parity == 0) or (m % 2 == 0 and starting_parity == 1).

This can be simplified to:

outcome = (m % 2) ^ starting_parity.

Because:

- If m is odd, outcome is starting_parity == 0 (1 if starting_parity is 0, 0 otherwise).

- If m is even, outcome is starting_parity == 1 (1 if starting_parity is 1, 0 otherwise).

Which is equivalent to (m % 2) XOR starting_parity.

For example:

m odd:

(m%2) is 1. XOR with starting_parity (0 or 1) gives starting_parity ^ 1. So if starting_parity is 0 (Alice), outcome is 1. If starting_parity is 1 (Bob), outcome is 0.

m even:

(m%2) is 0. XOR with starting_parity is starting_parity. If starting_parity is 1 (Bob), outcome is 1. If 0, outcome is 0.

This matches the previous examples.

Thus, the outcome for each bit i is (b_i % 2) XOR starting_parity, where starting_parity is 0 if the starting player is Alice, 1 if Bob.

Thus, the formula is:

outcome = (b_i % 2) ^ starting_parity.

But starting_parity is determined by the sum of higher bits and the number of zeros processed before this bit.

Now, the problem reduces to determining the starting_parity for each bit i, which is:

starting_parity = (sum_higher_processed + used_zeros_before_i) % 2.

But the players can choose used_zeros_before_i (mod 2) to either 0 or 1, provided that there are enough zeros.

The optimal choice for used_zeros_before_i is to maximize the outcome for Alice and minimize it for Bob.

Thus, for each bit i:

The players will choose used_zeros_before_i (mod 2) to set starting_parity to the value that maximizes the outcome for Alice if possible.

But since Alice and Bob are adversaries, the choice of used_zeros_before_i depends on who has control over the parity choice.

Wait, the players take turns processing elements. The zeros are part of the multiset, and each zero is processed in some turn. The order in which zeros are processed determines the starting_parity for each bit.

But this is complicated. However, since zeros don't affect x, their only role is to change the parity of the starting player for each bit.

Thus, the players can choose to process an even or odd number of zeros before processing each bit, but the number of zeros available may be limited.

But since the players are optimal, they will use the zeros to set the starting_parity for each bit to the best possible value.

Thus, for each bit i:

The players will choose used_zeros_before_i (mod 2) to maximize the outcome for Alice if possible.

But how?

The outcome for bit i is (b_i % 2) ^ starting_parity.

Alice wants this outcome to be 1. Bob wants it to be 0.

Thus, for each bit i:

If (b_i % 2) ^ starting_parity is 1, Alice benefits. Bob tries to avoid this.

The players can choose the starting_parity by choosing used_zeros_before_i (mod 2).

Thus, the optimal choice is:

- For Alice to choose the starting_parity that maximizes the outcome.

- For Bob to choose the starting_parity that minimizes the outcome.

But since the players alternate, the ability to choose the parity depends on whose turn it is to process the zeros.

This is getting very complex. However, there's a way to model this using the available zeros.

Let me think: the players can use any number of zeros before processing a bit to set the starting_parity. The number of zeros used can be even or odd. But since the zeros are processed in turns, the players can choose to process an even or odd number of zeros to adjust the starting_parity.

However, the parity of the number of zeros used before the bit is determined by the players' choices.

The key insight is that the player who has the choice to process the last zero before the bit can decide the parity.

But this depends on the number of available zeros.

But given that the players are optimal, they will use the zeros to set the starting_parity to the best possible value for their turn.

Thus, the optimal used_zeros_before_i (mod 2) is determined by the following:

For each bit i:

- The desired starting_parity is (b_i % 2) XOR desired_outcome.

But Alice wants the outcome to be 1, so desired_outcome is 1.

Thus, desired_starting_parity = (b_i % 2) XOR 1.

Bob wants desired_outcome to be 0, so desired_starting_parity = (b_i % 2) XOR 0.

But the players can choose to set the starting_parity to either 0 or 1, provided there are enough zeros.

But the players are competing, and the choice depends on who has control over the parity decision.

An alternative approach is to realize that the player who can control the parity of the zeros used before the bit will set the starting_parity to their advantage.

But this depends on whether there are any zeros left.

If there are any zeros left:

- The current player can choose to process an even or odd number of zeros to set the starting_parity.

But since zeros are processed in turn, the players will use the zeros to adjust the parity.

But this is getting too vague. Let's think of it in terms of the following steps:

1. For each bit i (processed from highest to lowest):

   a. Determine the current sum_higher = sum of elements processed so far (higher bits and zeros used before this bit).

   b. The starting_parity for bit i is sum_higher % 2.

   c. The outcome for bit i is (b_i % 2) XOR starting_parity.

   d. Alice and Bob will use the available zeros to adjust sum_higher's parity to maximize the outcome.

But this is not considering the zeros correctly.

Alternatively, the presence of zeros allows the players to adjust the starting_parity for each bit.

The total sum_higher_processed_so_far is sum of all higher bits processed plus the number of zeros processed before this bit.

The players can choose to process zeros before this bit to change the sum_higher_processed_so_far's parity.

The optimal choice is to set the parity to maximize the outcome for the current bit.

But the players must process the zeros in their turns, which affects the available zeros.

But this is still not clear.

Let's try to model this with the following steps:

We process bits from highest to lowest.

For each bit i:

   available_zeros = z.

   sum_higher = sum of elements processed so far (higher bits and zeros used before this bit).

   current starting_parity = sum_higher % 2.

   desired_parity = (b_i % 2) XOR 1 (to maximize outcome).

   if there are available zeros:

       the players can choose to use an even or odd number of zeros to adjust the starting_parity.

       if the current starting_parity is not desired_parity:

           use 1 zero (mod 2) to flip the parity.

           outcome becomes 1.

           available_zeros -= 1.

       else:

           use 0 zeros.

           outcome is 1.

   else:

       outcome is (b_i % 2) XOR starting_parity.

   sum_higher += used_zeros + b_i.

   z -= used_zeros.

But this is a simplified model and may not capture all cases.

Let's test this model on the sample input.

Sample Input:

k=2, z=0.

b = [2, 1].

Processing bit 1 (i=1):

sum_higher = 0.

available_zeros = 0.

starting_parity = 0.

desired_parity = (1 % 2) XOR 1 → 1 XOR 1 = 0.

So desired_parity is 0. Current starting_parity is 0. So outcome is (1 XOR 0) = 1.

sum_higher += 1 → sum_higher = 1.

z remains 0.

Processing bit 0 (i=0):

sum_higher = 1.

available_zeros = 0.

starting_parity = 1.

desired_parity = (2 % 2) XOR 1 → 0 XOR 1 = 1.

Current starting_parity is 1. So outcome is 0 XOR 1 = 1.

sum_higher += 2 → sum_higher = 3.

z remains 0.

The outcomes are [1, 1], so binary is 11. Which matches the sample.

Another test case: k=2, z=1.

b = [2, 1].

Processing bit 1:

sum_higher = 0.

available_zeros = 1.

desired_parity for bit 1 is (1%2) XOR 1 = 0.

current starting_parity is 0.

So no need to use zeros. outcome is 1 XOR 0 = 1.

sum_higher += 1 → 1.

z remains 1.

Processing bit 0:

sum_higher = 1.

available_zeros = 1.

desired_parity for bit 0 is (0) XOR 1 = 1.

current starting_parity is 1%2 = 1.

So desired_parity is 1, which matches current starting_parity.

Outcome is 0 XOR 1 = 1.

sum_higher += 0 zeros + 2 → sum_higher = 3.

z is 1.

Final outcome is 11.

But if there was a zero, how would it affect?

Another example: k=1, z=1.

b = [1].

Processing bit 0:

sum_higher = 0.

available_zeros =1.

desired_parity is (1%2) XOR 1 → 1 XOR 1 = 0.

current starting_parity is 0.

So need to use 0 zeros.

outcome is 1 XOR 0 =1.

sum_higher += 1 → 1.

z=1.

But then, after processing bit 0, there are 1 zeros left.

These zeros are processed after the bits. But zeros don't affect x, so they just contribute to the sum_higher for lower bits (but there are no lower bits).

Thus, the outcome is 1.

But what if z=1 and the players can choose to use the zero before processing bit 0?

Wait, no, in this example, there's only bit 0. The zero is processed before it. So starting_parity for bit 0 is sum_higher + used_zeros.

sum_higher is 0.

used_zeros can be 0 or 1.

If used_zeros is 1, starting_parity is 1.

outcome is (1%2) XOR 1 → 0.

But Alice wants the outcome to be 1. So she would choose to use 0 zeros.

Thus, the outcome is 1.

But according to the model, if there are available zeros, the players can choose to use 0 or 1 zeros (mod 2) to set the desired_parity.

Thus, the model seems to work.

Thus, the correct approach is:

For each bit i (processed from highest to lowest):

   available_zeros = current z.

   sum_higher = sum of higher bits processed so far plus any zeros used before this bit.

   current_parity = sum_higher % 2.

   desired_parity = (b_i % 2) ^ 1.

   if available_zeros > 0:

       if current_parity != desired_parity:

           used_zeros = 1 (mod 2).

           current_parity = desired_parity.

           available_zeros -= 1.

       else:

           used_zeros = 0.

   outcome = (b_i % 2) ^ current_parity.

   sum_higher += used_zeros + b_i.

   z = available_zeros.

   append outcome to the result.

But how to model this in code?

Wait, the desired_parity is (b_i % 2) ^ 1, which maximizes the outcome. But Bob would want to minimize the outcome, so desired_parity for Bob would be (b_i % 2) ^ 0.

But since the players are adversaries, the choice of used_zeros parity depends on whose turn it is to process the zeros.

This is where the initial model may have failed. The previous model assumed that Alice can choose to use zeros to set the desired_parity, but Bob may counter by using zeros to set a different parity.

Thus, the correct way to model this is to determine whether the players can set the starting_parity to their advantage based on the available zeros.

But this requires determining whether there are enough zeros to allow the players to set the desired parity.

An alternative approach is to realize that the players can use any number of zeros (even or odd) before processing a bit to set the starting_parity. The players will choose the parity that maximizes the outcome for Alice, given the available zeros.

Thus, the code should compute for each bit:

current_parity = (sum_higher + used_zeros_before_i) % 2.

The players can choose used_zeros_before_i (mod 2) to be 0 or 1, provided that there are enough zeros.

Thus, for each bit i:

- If there are any zeros remaining, the players can set used_zeros_before_i to 0 or 1, whichever maximizes the outcome.

- The outcome is (b_i % 2) ^ new_parity, where new_parity is (sum_higher + used_zeros_before_i) % 2.

Thus, the players will choose new_parity to maximize the outcome.

For example:

If (b_i % 2) == 1:

   outcome is 1 if new_parity is 0.

   outcome is 0 if new_parity is 1.

   So the players will set new_parity to 0 if possible.

If (b_i % 2) == 0:

   outcome is new_parity.

   So the players will set new_parity to 1 if possible.

Thus, the optimal new_parity for each bit is:

new_parity = (b_i % 2) ? 0 : 1.

But the players can choose new_parity by using zeros to adjust the sum_higher's parity.

Thus, the code should:

For each bit i:

   desired_parity = 1 if (b_i % 2) == 0 else 0.

   current_possible_parity = (sum_higher % 2) XOR (used_zeros % 2).

   if there are zeros remaining:

       new_parity = desired_parity.

       used_zeros_mod = (desired_parity - (sum_higher % 2)) % 2.

       if used_zeros_mod is 1 and z > 0:

           z -= 1.

           used_zeros += 1.

       else:

           used_zeros += 0.

   else:

       new_parity = sum_higher % 2.

   outcome = (b_i % 2) ^ new_parity.

   sum_higher += used_zeros + b_i.

But this is not precise.

Another approach is:

For each bit i:

   desired_parity = 1 if (b_i % 2) == 0 else 0.

   current_parity_without_zeros = sum_higher % 2.

   if z > 0:

       can_flip_parity = (current_parity_without_zeros != desired_parity).

       if can_flip_parity:

           used_zeros = 1.

           z -= 1.

           current_parity = desired_parity.

       else:

           used_zeros = 0.

           current_parity = current_parity_without_zeros.

   else:

       current_parity = current_parity_without_zeros.

   outcome = (b_i % 2) ^ current_parity.

   sum_higher += used_zeros + b_i.

This code snippet attempts to set the current_parity to the desired_parity using one zero if possible.

Let's test this with the sample.

Sample Input:

k=2, z=0.

bits: b_0=2, b_1=1.

Processing bit 1:

sum_higher starts at 0.

desired_parity for bit 1 (b_i=1) is 0.

current_parity_without_zeros = 0.

z=0.

current_parity = 0.

outcome = 1 ^ 0 = 1.

sum_higher += 0 + 1 = 1.

Processing bit 0:

b_i=2 (even).

desired_parity = 1.

current_parity_without_zeros = 1.

z=0.

current_parity=1.

outcome = 0 ^ 1 = 1.

sum_higher += 0 + 2 = 3.

Final outcome bits are [1, 1] → 11, which matches the sample.

Another example where z=1.

k=1, z=1, b_0=1.

Processing bit 0:

sum_higher=0.

desired_parity = 0 (since b_i=1).

current_parity_without_zeros=0.

z=1.

can_flip_parity = 0 == desired_parity 0 → no.

so used_zeros=0.

current_parity=0.

outcome=1 ^0=1.

sum_higher +=0+1=1.

z=1.

But after processing the bit, there is one zero left. However, since the zero can't affect any other bits, it's processed after all bits, but it doesn't affect x.

Thus, the outcome is 1.

This model seems to work.

Thus, the correct code is to process each bit from highest to lowest, for each bit:

- desired_parity is 0 if b_i is odd, 1 if even.

- if there are zeros available, check if the current_parity_without_zeros is different from desired_parity.

- if yes, use one zero to flip the parity.

- else, use zero zeros.

- compute the outcome as (b_i % 2) ^ current_parity.

- update sum_higher and z accordingly.

Thus, the code should be:

k, z = map(int, input().split())

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

outcomes = [0] * k

sum_higher = 0

for i in reversed(range(k)):

    current_b = b[i]

    desired_parity = 1 if current_b % 2 == 0 else 0

    current_parity_without_zeros = sum_higher % 2

    current_parity = current_parity_without_zeros

    used_zeros = 0

    if z > 0:

        if current_parity_without_zeros != desired_parity:

            used_zeros = 1

            z -= 1

            current_parity = desired_parity

    outcome = (current_b % 2) ^ current_parity

    outcomes[i] = outcome

    sum_higher += used_zeros + current_b

binary = ''.join(map(str, reversed(outcomes)))

print(binary)

Wait, but the way sum_higher is updated is sum_higher += used_zeros + current_b.

Yes, because sum_higher tracks the total elements processed so far (higher bits, used_zeros, and current_b).

But the order of processing is highest to lowest, and for each bit, the code correctly calculates the desired_parity and uses zeros if available.

Testing this code with the sample input:

Sample Input:

2 0

2 1

Processing bits in reversed order (i=1, then i=0).

i=1 (bit 1, current_b=1):

desired_parity = 0 (since current_b is odd).

current_parity_without_zeros = 0%2=0.

z=0, so no change.

outcome = 1 ^ 0 = 1.

sum_higher becomes 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

i=0 (bit 0, current_b=2):

desired_parity = 1 (since current_b is even).

current_parity_without_zeros = 1%2=1.

z=0.

outcome = 0 ^ 1 =1.

sum_higher becomes 1 + 0 + 2 =3.

outcomes are [1, 1].

Reversed to binary '11'.

Which is correct.

Another example where z=1:

k=1, z=1, b[0]=1.

i=0:

current_b=1, desired_parity=0.

current_parity_without_zeros=0%2=0.

z=1>0.

current_parity_without_zeros == desired_parity, so no used_zeros.

outcome = 1 ^0=1.

sum_higher becomes 0 +0 +1=1.

z remains 1.

Thus, outcome is 1.

Thus, the code seems to handle this correctly.

Thus, this should be the correct code.
