Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find the maximum possible p such that after removing at most k elements from the array, the remaining array is p-towering. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's understand what a p-towering array is. The array has to have an index i such that for every element b_j in the array (after removal), b_j >= p - |i - j|. So, each element must be at least as big as p minus the distance from the peak i. The peak is the position where this condition is tightest, probably where the value is the highest.

Hmm. So for each possible i in the modified array, we can calculate the minimal required p such that all elements in the array satisfy the condition. The maximum p over all possible i and possible arrays (after removing up to k elements) is the answer.

But how do we efficiently compute this? Because checking every possible i and every possible subset after removing k elements is computationally impossible for large n.

Let me think of binary search. Maybe we can binary search on possible p values. For a given p, check if there's a way to remove at most k elements such that there exists an index i in the remaining array where all elements satisfy a_j >= p - |i - j|.

If we can perform this check efficiently for a given p, then binary search would work. Let's see how to do that.

The check function: For a given p, can we find a window in the array (after deleting up to k elements) such that there exists an i where for all elements in the window, a_j >= p - |i - j|. And the length of the window is at least m = (n -k).

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal i is somewhere in the array, and we need to find the best possible i and the minimal number of deletions required around i to satisfy the condition.

Wait, but when considering a possible p, for each position j in the original array, the required a_j is at least p - |i - j|. So for a given p, for each j, the minimal a_j allowed depends on the distance from i. So, for each possible i in the original array, how many elements in the array (in a certain window around i) meet the condition a_j >= p - |i - j|. Then, the question is, can we select a window around i (with some possible deletions) where the number of elements that meet the condition is >= (required length m = n -k) minus the number of allowed deletions (k). Wait, maybe not. Let me rephrase.

Wait, for a given p and a candidate peak position i (original array's index), the elements in the modified array must all be >= p - |i' - j'|, where i' is the position of the peak in the modified array. But this complicates things because the modified array's indices are different. So maybe considering the original array's indices is tricky.

Alternative approach: For the modified array (after deletions), which is a subarray of the original array, the peak i' is within this subarray. So, the positions j' in the subarray must satisfy a_j' (original array's a_j') >= p - |i' - j'|. But since the subarray is a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous?), wait, no. Wait, the problem says "remove at most k elements", so the remaining array is a subarray in the original order but with some elements deleted. So the indices in the modified array are consecutive in the original array. Wait no. Wait, when you delete elements, the remaining elements must stay in order. So the modified array is a subsequence of the original array. For example, if original is [1,2,3,4], deleting 2 gives [1,3,4], which is a subsequence, but their positions are now in the modified array as 1, 3, 4 (original indices). But the positions in the modified array are 1, 2, 3. So the peak i' in the modified array is a position in the modified array. So the original indices are shifted. Hmm, but how does this affect the condition?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: find a peak at original index i, and a set of elements around i (within some left and right limits) such that for each element j in this set, a_j >= p - |i - j|. Then, the total number of elements in this set must be at least (n -k). But how to model the selection of such a set with minimal deletions?

Alternatively, for each possible peak i in the original array, we can compute the minimal number of deletions required to form a p-towering array with peak at i. Then, the minimal deletions across all possible i should be <=k. But how to compute this for each i and p?

Hmm. Let's think of the problem for a fixed p. Then, for each i, we can check how many elements in the array are >= p - |i - j|. But the elements must form a contiguous sequence around i, or can they be non-contiguous? Wait, no. Because the modified array can be any subsequence (elements in order, but not necessarily contiguous). So, the peak i in the modified array could be any position in the modified array. But the original array's indices are different.

Wait, maybe the optimal scenario is to choose a peak in the original array, and then select a window of elements around it where a_j >= p - |i - j|. Then, the minimal deletions would be the number of elements not in that window. But the problem allows us to delete elements anywhere, not necessarily around i. However, the condition a_j >= p - |i - j| implies that elements far from i (distance greater than p-1) would need to have a_j >= negative numbers, which is always true. Wait, p can be as large as possible, but if p is large, then for j far from i, the right-hand side p - |i-j| could be large, so a_j must be >= that. So the peak i is where the condition is tightest.

But maybe the maximum p is determined by the maximum possible a_i plus the possible extensions to the left and right. For example, for a peak at i, the required a_j's are >= p - |i -j|. So the maximum p would be the minimal (a_j + |i -j|) for j in the selected array. But we need to select a subset of the array where the minimal (a_j + |i-j|) is as large as possible.

Wait, for a given subset and peak i, p can be at most min_{j in subset} (a_j + |i-j|). Because for each j, a_j >= p - |i-j| => p <= a_j + |i-j|. So the maximum p possible for a subset and peak i is the minimum of (a_j + |i-j|) for all j in the subset. To maximize p, we want the subset to have a high minimum of (a_j + |i-j|).

So the problem reduces to finding a subset of at least (n -k) elements where there exists an i such that the minimum of (a_j + |i -j|) over the subset is as large as possible.

But how do we compute this efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as for each possible peak position i (original index), find the maximum p_i such that there's a subset of elements including i (or not?) where at least (n-k) elements have a_j >= p_i - |i-j|, and p_i is as large as possible. Then, the overall maximum p is the maximum over all i's p_i.

But how to compute p_i for a given i.

Alternatively, for a given i, the maximum possible p_i is the maximum p such that in the array, the number of elements where a_j >= p - |i-j| is at least (n-k). Because we can delete up to k elements, the remaining (n-k) elements must all satisfy a_j >= p - |i-j|. Wait, no. Because when you delete elements, you can choose which ones to keep, so for a given i and p, the required elements must all be in the subset. So for a given i and p, the subset must consist of elements j where a_j >= p - |i-j|. The size of this subset must be at least (n-k). Then, the maximum p for i is the maximum p where the number of elements j in the array with a_j >= p - |i-j| is >= (n -k). Then, the maximum p_i is the largest p where the count of such j's is >= (n -k).

But how to find this p_i for each i.

Alternatively, for each i, the maximum possible p_i is the minimum of (a_j + |i-j|) for the (n -k) elements with the largest a_j + |i-j|. Because to have (n-k) elements where a_j >= p_i - |i-j|, p_i can be at most the minimum of (a_j + |i-j|) among those (n-k) elements. So for each i, we can collect all the a_j + |i-j| values, sort them in descending order, take the (n -k)-th largest, which would be the maximum p_i possible for that i. Then, the overall maximum p is the maximum over all i's of p_i.

But if that's the case, then the approach would be:

For each test case:

1. For each possible i (from 0 to n-1, assuming 0-based indices), compute all a_j + |i-j| for all j.

2. For each i, collect all these values, sort them in non-decreasing order.

3. Find the (n -k)-th smallest element in this sorted list. That would be the maximum p_i for this i, since we can select the (n-k) elements with the largest a_j + |i-j|, and p_i is the minimum of those, which is the (n-k)th largest (so when sorted in descending order, the (n-k-1)th index). Wait, perhaps not. Let's see.

Wait, for a given i, each element j contributes a_j + |i-j|. The maximum possible p_i is such that there are at least (n -k) elements where a_j + |i-j| >= p_i. Because p_i is the minimum of the selected (n -k) elements' a_j + |i-j|. So the maximum possible p_i is the (n -k)-th largest a_j + |i-j| among all j in the array.

So for each i, compute the (n -k)th largest value in the list [a_j + |i-j| for all j], then the maximum p_i is that value, and the answer is the maximum over all i of p_i.

Wait, but if for a certain i, the (n -k)th largest a_j + |i-j| is x, then there are (n -k) elements j where a_j + |i-j| >=x. So selecting those elements, the minimum among them is x. Therefore, the p_i is x, since all elements in the subset must have a_j >= p_i - |i-j|, which is equivalent to a_j + |i-j| >= p_i, so p_i can be at most the minimum of a_j + |i-j| in the subset. To maximize p_i, we need to choose the subset with the largest possible minimum a_j + |i-j|, which would be the (n -k)th largest value.

So the maximum p_i for i is the (n -k)th largest a_j + |i-j| across all j. Then, the answer is the maximum of these p_i's over all i.

But if (n -k) is larger than the number of elements in the array (but since k can be 0, n -k can be up to n). So for each i, we need to select (n -k) elements where a_j + |i -j| is as large as possible, and take the minimum of those. The (n -k)th largest in the array for each i.

But for each i, how do we compute this efficiently?

If n is up to 2e5, and for each i, we need to process O(n) elements, that's O(n^2), which is way too slow.

So this approach isn't feasible. Therefore, we need a smarter way.

Alternative idea: Binary search over p. For each possible p, check if there exists an i such that the number of elements j where a_j >= p - |i -j| is at least (n -k). Then, the answer is the maximum p where this is possible.

This approach would require O(log(max_p)) steps, and for each step, checking all possible i's. But even that might be O(n log max_p), which is manageable.

But how to check for a given p, whether there exists an i where the number of elements j with a_j >= p - |i -j| is >= (n -k).

How to compute the maximum count of elements j for any i, where a_j >= p - |i -j|.

So for a given p, the problem reduces to: find an i (position in the original array) such that the number of j's where a_j + |i - j| >= p is at least (n -k). So for each j, a_j + |i -j| >= p.

Wait, no. Wait, the condition is a_j >= p - |i -j|. Rearranged, a_j + |i -j| >= p. So yes, exactly. So for a given p, the j's that satisfy a_j + |i -j| >= p are the ones that can be included in the subset when the peak is at i. The goal is to find an i where the number of such j's is at least (n -k).

So the question is, for a given p, does there exist an i such that the number of j where a_j + |i -j| >= p is >= m, where m = n -k.

So, how to compute for each j, the possible i's where a_j + |i -j| >= p. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, for each j, the set of i's where a_j + |i-j| >= p is the interval [j - (a_j - (p - x)), j + (a_j - (p -x))]? Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as |i-j| >= p - a_j. Wait, a_j + |i-j| >= p is equivalent to |i-j| >= p - a_j. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, a_j + |i -j| >= p → |i-j| >= p - a_j. But p - a_j can be negative. So if a_j >= p, then |i-j| can be anything (since |i-j| >= a negative number is always true). So for j where a_j >= p, the condition is satisfied for any i. For j where a_j < p, then |i-j| >= (p - a_j) → i is <= j - (p - a_j) or i >= j + (p -a_j). So for each j, the valid i's are in the ranges outside [j - (p - a_j), j + (p - a_j)].

But this seems tricky. However, we need to find an i such that the number of j's where i is not in the forbidden interval [j - (p -a_j), j + (p -a_j)] (for j where a_j < p) or j's where a_j >=p (which are always allowed).

Wait, no. For a_j >= p, then the condition is always true, so j is always counted. For a_j < p, the condition is true only if i is outside [j - (p -a_j), j + (p -a_j)].

So, for j where a_j < p: j's contribution to the count is 1 if i is not in [j - (p -a_j), j + (p -a_j)], else 0.

For j where a_j >= p: j's contribution is 1 regardless of i.

So the problem becomes: for a given p, compute the maximum over all possible i of the count of j's where:

if a_j < p → i is not in [j - (p - a_j), j + (p - a_j)]

plus the number of j's where a_j >= p.

Then, check if this maximum count is >= m.

If this is possible, then p is feasible.

So how to compute this maximum count efficiently?

Hmm. Let's split the array into two parts:

1. Those j where a_j >= p: they contribute 1 to the count for any i.

Let C = the number of such j's.

2. Those j where a_j < p: for each such j, the i must not lie in the interval [j - (p -a_j), j + (p -a_j)].

So for these j's, the forbidden interval for i is [L_j, R_j], where L_j = j - (p - a_j) and R_j = j + (p -a_j).

Now, the problem reduces to: find an i such that the number of forbidden intervals [L_j, R_j] that do NOT contain i, plus C, is >= m.

Wait, no. For each j in the second category (a_j < p), the count increases by 1 if i is not in [L_j, R_j]. So the total count for i is C + (number of j in second category where i is not in [L_j, R_j]).

We need to find whether there exists an i where C + (total_second - count_included) >= m, where count_included is the number of j in second category where i is in [L_j, R_j].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the forbidden intervals for j in the second category. For each j, the forbidden interval is [L_j, R_j]. For i in this interval, j does not contribute to the count. So the count for i is C + (total_second - the number of intervals that include i).

But total_second is the number of j's in the second category. So the count for i is (C + total_second) - (number of intervals covering i).

We need this to be >= m.

So, the problem reduces to: is there an i where (C + total_second) - (number of intervals covering i) >= m?

Rearranged: number of intervals covering i <= (C + total_second - m).

But m = n -k. So C + total_second is the total number of j's (since C is the count of a_j >=p, and total_second is the rest). So C + total_second = n. So (C + total_second - m) = n - (n -k) = k.

So the condition is: does there exist an i where the number of intervals covering i is <= k?

In other words, the minimal number of intervals covering any i is <=k. So, the question is: is there a point i where the number of intervals that include i is <=k?

If yes, then p is feasible.

So, for a given p, the steps are:

1. Compute C = number of j where a_j >= p.

2. For the remaining j (a_j < p), compute their intervals [L_j, R_j], where L_j = j - (p -a_j) and R_j = j + (p -a_j).

3. Check if there exists an i where the number of intervals covering i is <=k.

But how to do this efficiently.

The problem is now to find if there exists any i such that the number of intervals [L_j, R_j] covering i is <=k.

But even this seems challenging. How can we compute the minimal number of intervals covering any point?

This is a classic line sweep problem. We can find the minimal number of intervals covering any point by processing the intervals and tracking the coverage.

Let me think.

Each interval is [L_j, R_j]. We can represent all the start and end points of the intervals. Then, we can perform a sweep line algorithm to track the number of overlapping intervals at each point. The minimal number of overlapping intervals across all points can be found this way.

But wait, we need to find if any point i has overlapping intervals count <=k.

So the minimal overlapping count across all points must be <=k.

But how to compute the minimal number of overlapping intervals.

But intervals can be very large. For example, if p is large, then for j where a_j is small, L_j and R_j could be way outside the array's original bounds.

So, the intervals may not even overlap with the array's indices (which are from 1 to n, assuming 1-based or 0-based? The problem statement says the array is a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, so probably 1-based indices. But in code, it's easier to handle 0-based.

But regardless, the intervals [L_j, R_j] can be anywhere on the integer line. But the i's are positions in the array (or any integer?), but since i is an index in the original array, the possible i's are 1-based or 0-based. Wait, in the problem statement, the array can have elements removed, but the peak i is in the modified array. But the original array's indices may not correspond. Wait, but the problem says that after deletions, the peak is in the modified array. So the i can be any position in the modified array, but the modified array's elements are a subset of the original array's elements. However, in the original array, the j's are the original indices, and the i can be any position in the modified array. So when considering possible i's, they can be any position in the original array's elements (but after deletions, the indices are shifted). This complicates things.

But perhaps when considering i in the original array's positions, we can model the intervals for the original indices. Because even if we delete elements, the i in the modified array must have come from some position in the original array (since the elements are kept in order).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's get back to the problem.

In our approach for the binary search step, for a given p, we have to compute whether there exists an i (could be any integer, but in the original array's indices) such that the number of intervals covering i is <=k. But even if i is outside the original array's indices, but when considering the modified array's indices, which are determined after deletions, it's possible. But since the modified array is a subsequence of the original array, the positions in the modified array are contiguous in the original array's order, but their indices are now 1, 2, ..., m (m = n -k). So the peak i in the modified array can be any position in 1..m. But how does this affect the intervals [L_j, R_j]?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model i as any integer. Because even if the modified array's indices are shifted, the original j's are considered. For example, if the modified array's peak is at position i', which corresponds to original index j, then the intervals [L_j, R_j] are calculated based on the original j's. So in this case, the i in the original array's index is j, and the condition is that the elements in the modified array (which is a subset of the original array) have a_j >= p - |i' - j'|, where j' is the position in the modified array. But this is not directly helpful.

This seems to be a dead end. Let's try to find another approach.

Alternative idea: For the binary search step, the key is to check if there exists an i such that the number of j's where a_j + |i-j| >= p is >= m =n -k.

But how to compute this for a given p?

Let's think of the problem as follows: For each j, the condition a_j + |i-j| >= p can be rewritten as:

i <= j + (a_j - p) or i >= j - (a_j - p) + ?

Wait, no. Let's expand the condition a_j + |i-j| >= p.

Which is equivalent to |i-j| >= p - a_j.

But since |i-j| >= (p -a_j) can be split into two cases:

If p -a_j <=0 → p <=a_j → then |i-j| >= something non-positive. Which is always true. So for j where a_j >=p, any i satisfies the condition.

For j where a_j < p → then |i-j| >= (p -a_j). So i <= j - (p -a_j) OR i >= j + (p -a_j).

So for these j's, the i must be in (-infinity, j - (p -a_j)] OR [j + (p -a_j), +infinity).

So for a given p, the number of j's that are allowed (a_j >=p) is C.

For the remaining j's (a_j <p), the allowed i's are the union of two intervals: (-inf, L_j] and [R_j, inf), where L_j = j - (p -a_j), R_j = j + (p -a_j).

So the problem becomes: find if there's an i such that the number of allowed j's is >= m.

Which is equivalent to:

C + number of j (a_j <p) where i is in (-inf, L_j] OR [R_j, inf) >= m.

But since m =n -k, and C is the number of j with a_j >=p, and the rest is (n -C), the condition becomes:

number of j (a_j <p) where i is in (-inf, L_j] OR [R_j, inf) >= (m - C).

Which is equivalent to:

number of j (a_j <p) where i is not in (L_j, R_j) >= (m - C).

But (m - C) can be negative. Wait, m =n -k. So if C >=m, then (m -C) is <=0, so the condition is automatically true. So in this case, there exists such i.

So, for a given p, if C >=m, then the answer is yes.

Otherwise, we need to check if there exists an i such that the number of j (a_j <p) where i is not in (L_j, R_j) >= (m -C).

But since (m -C) is (n -k -C), and since C is the number of j with a_j >=p, the j with a_j <p is (n - C). So the condition is that (number of j (a_j <p) and i not in (L_j, R_j)) >= (m -C).

But for j (a_j <p), we can model their allowed regions as (-inf, L_j] OR [R_j, inf). For each such j, the allowed i's are outside (L_j, R_j).

We need to find an i that is allowed by at least (m -C) of these j's.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, the number of j's (a_j <p) that allow i is equal to (number of j where i <= L_j) + (number of j where i >= R_j).

So for each i, the total allowed is C + (number of j where a_j <p and (i <=L_j or i >= R_j)).

We need this total >= m.

But how to compute this for all possible i.

This seems challenging. But perhaps we can find the maximum number of allowed j's (a_j <p) for any i, and check if this maximum plus C >=m.

So, the maximum number of j's (a_j <p) that can allow i is (n - C) - (minimal number of j's (a_j <p) that include i in their intervals (L_j, R_j)).

Because allowed j's for i are those where i is not in (L_j, R_j). So the number of allowed j's is (n - C) - (number of j's where i is in (L_j, R_j)).

So to maximize allowed j's, we need to minimize the number of intervals (L_j, R_j) that contain i.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of intervals (L_j, R_j) that cover any i. If the minimal number is <= (n - C) - (m - C) → (n - C) - (m -C) = n -m =k.

Wait, m =n -k. So n -m =k.

So the minimal number of intervals covering any i must be <=k.

If this is true, then the maximum allowed j's is (n -C) - minimal_count >= (n -C) -k = (n -k -C) = (m -C). Which is exactly what we need.

So for the case when C <m (i.e., when there are not enough j's with a_j >=p), the problem is to find if there exists an i where the number of intervals (L_j, R_j) that contain i is <=k.

So the algorithm for checking p is feasible is:

Compute C = number of j with a_j >=p.

If C >=m → feasible.

Else:

Compute all intervals (L_j, R_j) for j where a_j <p.

Check if there exists an i such that the number of intervals covering i is <=k.

If yes, then feasible.

So the problem now is how to check whether any i is covered by at most k intervals.

How can we do this efficiently?

This is a standard interval problem. To find the minimal number of overlapping intervals over any point.

If the minimal number is <=k, then yes.

So the question is: can we find the minimal number of overlapping intervals.

But the intervals can be very large. However, the minimal number will occur either at a point between the endpoints of the intervals or at the endpoints.

So, we can collect all the events (start and end of intervals) and perform a sweep line algorithm.

The steps would be:

1. Collect all the start and end points of the intervals (L_j, R_j) for j where a_j <p.

2. Sort all the events in order. Each event is a point x, and a type (start or end).

3. Sweep through the events, keeping track of the current number of active intervals.

4. The minimal number of active intervals during the sweep is the minimal number of overlapping intervals.

Wait, no. The sweep line algorithm can track the maximum number of overlapping intervals, but how to track the minimal?

The minimal number of overlapping intervals is zero if there exists a point not covered by any interval. Otherwise, it's 1 or more.

But we need to find whether any point is covered by <=k intervals.

So, the minimal number is the minimal possible. If the minimal number is <=k, then yes.

So the approach is:

Sort all the interval endpoints. Then, between each consecutive pair of events, determine the number of overlapping intervals in that interval and see if it's <=k.

But how to do this.

Alternatively, think of the intervals as sorted by their start and end points.

The sweep line algorithm would track the current number of active intervals. Between two consecutive events (points x1 and x2), the number of active intervals is the same. So during the sweep, we can track the minimal number of active intervals in any interval between events.

But how?

For example, between two consecutive events (points x and x'), the active intervals are constant.

So, during the sweep, whenever we enter a new interval (x, x'), the current active count is known. We can record the minimal active count across all these intervals.

But there's a problem: the events are sorted, but when you process a start event, you increment the active count, and when you process an end event, you decrement. So the active count changes at each event point.

But the minimal active count could be between events.

For example, after processing a start event, the active count increases. So the minimal active count between the previous event and this event is the previous active count.

So, to compute the minimal active count between events, we can track the current active count before each event.

The steps would be:

Sort all the events (each start and end) in a list.

Initialize current_active =0.

prev_point = -infinity.

min_active = infinity.

For each event in sorted order:

   x = event.point.

   if prev_point <x:

       The interval (prev_point, x) has current_active active intervals.

       If current_active < min_active:

           min_active = current_active

   if event is a start:

       current_active +=1

   else:

       current_active -=1

   prev_point =x.

After processing all events, also check the interval (prev_point, +infinity), which has current_active=0.

So, the minimal_active is the minimum between all intervals and the final interval.

If minimal_active <=k, then yes.

So, with this approach, we can compute the minimal number of overlapping intervals.

Now, the problem is to generate all the intervals (L_j, R_j) for j where a_j <p.

But note that for j where a_j <p, L_j = j - (p -a_j), R_j = j + (p -a_j).

But what if p -a_j is not integer? Wait, j and a_j are integers, p could be a real number. Wait, but in the problem, p is an integer?

Wait, the problem says nothing about p being an integer. But the sample inputs and outputs have p as integers. But the problem allows p to be any real number, but the answer would be the maximum possible p, which could be a real.

But in the binary search, perhaps we can handle p as a real, and use a sufficiently small epsilon. However, given that the answer must be precise, perhaps p can be determined to be the minimum of a_j + |i-j| for some subset, which would be an integer if all a_j's are integers. Because a_j and |i-j| are integers.

Wait, a_j is given as integers (from the input). So, a_j + |i-j| is an integer, so the minimal value in the subset is also an integer. Hence, p must be an integer.

So, in binary search, we can restrict to integers.

Therefore, during binary search, p is an integer.

So, for a given integer p, we can compute all the intervals as L_j = j - (p -a_j), R_j = j + (p -a_j).

But j is the index in the array (assuming 1-based or 0-based). Let's assume 1-based for the problem statement (the sample input shows a_1 to a_5, and i=4 as a peak). So j is 1-based.

Wait, the sample input has the array [2,1,4,5,2], and i=4 (5 is the fourth element, 1-based). So in that case, j=4.

So for j=4 (a_j=5), the condition for p=3:

5 >= 3 - |i-j|. The i in this case is 4. So for j=4, |i-j|=0 → 5 >=3 → yes.

So, in code, perhaps the array is 1-based.

But when coding, it's easier to handle 0-based indices. So need to be careful.

So, for a given p, and j (0-based index), L_j = j - (p - a_j) +1? Or perhaps I need to adjust based on the actual indexing.

Wait, regardless of whether j is 0-based or 1-based, the code should handle it correctly. Let's assume that j is 0-based in code.

So, for j in 0-based, the original array is a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}.

So for j-th element, L_j = j - (p -a_j) ?

Yes, because |i-j| is the distance between i and j. So, for example, if j is 3 (0-based, fourth element), and p is 3, a_j=5: L_j =3 - (3-5) =3 +2=5, R_j=3 + (3-5)=3-2=1. Wait, that would make R_j=1, which is less than L_j=5. That can't be right.

Wait, no. Wait, for a_j <p, p -a_j is positive.

So L_j = j - (p -a_j), R_j = j + (p -a_j).

But if p -a_j is larger than j, then L_j could be negative. For example, j=0, a_j=1, p=3: L_j=0 - (3-1) =0-2= -2, R_j=0 +2=2.

So the interval is [-2, 2). Wait, but how are the intervals defined?

Wait, the condition is i not in (L_j, R_j), so the interval (L_j, R_j) is open? Or closed?

Wait, the original condition is |i-j| >= (p -a_j). So when |i-j| is exactly (p -a_j), then it's allowed. So i can be at L_j = j - (p -a_j) or R_j = j + (p -a_j). So the forbidden interval is (L_j, R_j), which is open. Because i can be equal to L_j or R_j.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine the condition: |i-j| >= (p -a_j).

So, when i is equal to j - (p -a_j) or j + (p -a_j), then |i-j| = p -a_j, which satisfies the condition >= p -a_j. So i can be at those points.

Thus, the forbidden interval is (L_j, R_j), not including the endpoints. Wait, no. The condition is |i-j| >= d (d = p -a_j). So i can be <= j -d or >= j +d. The forbidden region is j -d < i < j +d. So the forbidden interval is (j -d, j +d). So, open interval.

But the endpoints are allowed.

So, the forbidden interval for j is (L_j, R_j) = (j -d, j +d), where d = p -a_j.

So, the allowed i's are <= L_j or >= R_j.

Thus, for the intervals, the forbidden is the open interval between L_j and R_j.

Therefore, when we model the intervals (L_j, R_j) as open intervals, then the number of j's that include i in their forbidden interval is the number of intervals where L_j <i < R_j.

But in code, how do we model this?

In the sweep line algorithm, open intervals are tricky. However, since we are dealing with integer i's (since j is integer and d is integer, L_j and R_j are integers), the open interval (L_j, R_j) is equivalent to the closed interval [L_j +1, R_j -1]. Because for integer i, L_j <i <R_j → i is in [L_j+1, R_j-1].

So, for example, if L_j=2, R_j=5 (open interval), then i can be 3,4. So equivalent to closed interval [3,4].

Thus, to model the forbidden interval (L_j, R_j) for integer i, we can represent the forbidden interval as [L_j+1, R_j-1].

So, for each j where a_j <p, compute d = p -a_j.

Then, L_j = j -d.

R_j = j +d.

The forbidden interval is [L_j+1, R_j-1], which is the same as (L_j, R_j) for integers.

So, in code, we can adjust the intervals to [L_j +1, R_j -1].

Thus, the problem reduces to:

For each j where a_j <p:

compute start_j = L_j +1 = j -d +1 = j - (p -a_j) +1 = j + a_j -p +1.

end_j = R_j -1 = j +d -1 = j + (p -a_j) -1 = j + p -a_j -1.

Wait, no:

Wait, d = p -a_j.

start_j = L_j +1 = (j -d) +1 = j - (p -a_j) +1.

end_j = R_j -1 = (j +d) -1 = j + (p -a_j) -1.

So the forbidden interval for j is [start_j, end_j], which is a closed interval of integers.

So for example, if j=0, a_j=1, p=3: d=2, start_j=0-2+1= -1, end_j=0+2-1=1. So the forbidden interval is [-1,1], which for integer i would be i in {-1, 0,1}. So any i in this range is forbidden.

So, for each j where a_j <p, the forbidden interval is [j - (p -a_j) +1, j + (p -a_j) -1].

Thus, in code, for each j:

if a_j >=p → no forbidden interval.

else:

start = j - (p -a_j) +1

end = j + (p -a_j) -1

These are the forbidden intervals.

Now, the problem is to find if there exists an integer i such that the number of forbidden intervals covering i is <=k.

So, this is equivalent to finding if the minimal number of intervals covering any integer i is <=k.

Thus, the algorithm becomes:

For a given p:

1. Compute C = number of j where a_j >=p.

If C >= m → return True.

Else:

2. For each j where a_j <p:

   compute start_j = j - (p -a_j) +1

   compute end_j = j + (p -a_j) -1

   So forbidden interval is [start_j, end_j].

3. Collect all these intervals.

4. Check if there exists an integer i covered by at most k intervals.

   To do this, perform a sweep line to find the minimal number of overlapping intervals.

   If the minimal count is <=k → return True.

Else → return False.

So, the key steps are:

- Generate the intervals.

- Check if any point is covered by <=k intervals.

The next question is how to handle these intervals efficiently.

The intervals can be very large. For example, if p is very large, then a_j <p, and (p -a_j) is large, leading to start_j and end_j being very far apart.

But the minimal count of overlapping intervals is determined by the regions where the intervals overlap. However, the minimal count could be zero, which is possible if there are gaps between intervals.

But to compute the minimal number of overlapping intervals, we can proceed with the sweep line algorithm.

But in practice, for the code, it's manageable.

So, let's outline the code steps for a single test case:

Read n, k, and a array.

Compute m =n -k.

Binary search for the maximum p.

Initialize low =1, high = maximum possible p (like max(a) + n).

While low <=high:

   mid = (low + high) //2

   check if feasible(mid):

      compute C = number of elements >= mid.

      if C >=m → feasible.

      else:

         generate all forbidden intervals for j where a_j <mid.

         collect all intervals [start_j, end_j].

         sort all interval start and end points.

         perform sweep line to find minimal overlapping intervals.

         if minimal <=k → feasible.

   if feasible → set low=mid+1.

   else → set high=mid-1.

The final answer is high.

But the question is, how to handle the intervals and the sweep line.

But the number of intervals can be up to O(n) per check. For n=2e5, and binary search steps up to 30, this would be O(2e5 *30) =6e6 operations, which is manageable.

So, in code, for each check:

For the forbidden intervals:

For each j in 0..n-1:

   if a_j <p:

       d = p -a_j

       start_j = j -d +1

       end_j = j +d -1

       add interval (start_j, end_j)

But j is 0-based?

Wait, in code, j ranges from 0 to n-1 (assuming 0-based array).

But the problem states that the array is 1-based in the sample input. So perhaps the code should treat j as 1-based. But for code, it's easier to use 0-based.

But for the sample input where j=4 (0-based) would be a_j=5, which is the fourth element in 0-based (indices 0,1,2,3,4 for n=5).

But this is manageable.

But let's proceed with 0-based indices.

So, code steps:

For each j in 0..n-1:

   if a_j <p:

       d = p -a_j

       start_j = j -d +1

       end_j = j +d -1

       interval is [start_j, end_j]

Then, collect all these intervals.

Now, for the sweep line algorithm, we need to generate events for the start and end of each interval.

Each interval [s, e] contributes two events: (s, +1), (e+1, -1). Because the interval [s, e] is covered from s to e inclusive. So for example, the interval [2,5] starts at 2, ends at 5. So the events are at 2 (+1), 6 (-1).

Then, when sorted, the events are processed in order.

The sweep line algorithm proceeds as follows:

Sort all events by x. If x is the same, then process the end events before start events (because if two events are at the same x, the end event should come first to minimize the current count).

But wait, when x is the same:

For example, if we have an end event at x and a start event at x, processing the end first will decrement the count, then the start will increment. This correctly models the intervals.

So, for events at the same x, process end events (-1) before start events (+1).

Once the events are sorted, we can sweep through them, tracking the current_active count and the minimal_active count.

So, code for the sweep line:

events = list()

for interval in intervals:

    s, e = interval

    events.append( (s, 1) )  # start, +1

    events.append( (e +1, -1) )  # end is e, so the interval covers up to e. The end event is at e+1.

Sort events:

events.sort( key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]) )

Then, during the sweep:

current_active =0

min_active = infinity

prev_x = None

for x, delta in events:

    if prev_x is not None and x > prev_x:

        # the interval [prev_x, x) has current_active

        if current_active < min_active:

            min_active = current_active

    current_active += delta

    prev_x =x

# After processing all events, check the region after the last event.

if current_active < min_active:

    min_active = current_active

But wait, after the last event, current_active can be zero. So the interval [last_x, +inf) has current_active=0. So we need to check that.

Thus, after the loop, we can add:

if current_active < min_active:

    min_active = current_active

So, the minimal_active is the minimum between all intervals and the final interval.

If min_active <=k → feasible.

Thus, putting it all together.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

5 0

2 1 4 5 2

Sample Output:3.

Let's see.

For p=3.

Compute C = number of elements >=3.

a = [2,1,4,5,2]. 4 and5 are >=3 → C=2.

m =5-0=5. C=2 <5.

So need to generate intervals for j where a_j <3.

j=0: a_j=2 <3. d=3-2=1.

start_j=0 -1 +1=0. end_j=0+1-1=0. Interval [0,0].

j=1: a_j=1 <3. d=2.

start_j=1-2+1=0. end_j=1+2-1=2. interval [0,2].

j=4: a_j=2 <3. d=1. start=4-1+1=4. end=4+1-1=4. interval [4,4].

Other j's (j=2,3) have a_j >=3 → no intervals.

So intervals are:

[0,0], [0,2], [4,4].

Now, the events are:

For [0,0]: s=0, e=0 → events (0, +1), (1, -1)

For [0,2]: s=0, e=2 → events (0, +1), (3, -1)

For [4,4]: s=4, e=4 → events (4, +1), (5, -1)

Sorted events:

(0, +1), (0, +1), (1, -1), (3, -1), (4, +1), (5, -1)

Processing:

prev_x = None.

current_active=0.

min_active = infinity.

First event x=0, delta=+1:

prev_x is None. So prev_x is set to 0.

current_active becomes 1.

Next event x=0, delta=+1:

prev_x is 0. x=0 == prev_x. So no interval between.

current_active becomes 2.

prev_x is 0.

Next event x=1, delta=-1:

prev_x is0. x=1>0:

Check interval [0,1) → current_active=2. min_active is 2.

current_active becomes 2-1=1.

prev_x=1.

Next event x=3, delta=-1:

x=3>1: interval [1,3) → current_active=1. min_active is 1.

current_active becomes 1-1=0.

prev_x=3.

Next event x=4, delta=+1:

x>3: interval [3,4) → current_active=0. min_active is 0.

current_active becomes 0+1=1.

prev_x=4.

Next event x=5, delta=-1:

x>4: interval [4,5) → current_active=1. min_active is 0.

current_active becomes 0.

prev_x=5.

After loop:

Check current_active=0. min_active=0.

So min_active is 0 <=k=0.

Thus, feasible.

So p=3 is possible.

But what about higher p?

For example, p=4.

C= number of elements >=4 → a_2=4, a_3=5 → C=2.

m=5. C=2 <5.

Generate intervals for j where a_j <4.

j=0: a=2 → d=4-2=2. start=0-2+1= -1. end=0+2-1=1. interval [-1,1].

j=1: a=1 → d=3. start=1-3+1= -1. end=1+3-1=3. interval [-1,3].

j=4: a=2 → d=2. start=4-2+1=3. end=4+2-1=5. interval [3,5].

j=2: a=4 >=4 → no interval.

j=3: a=5 >=4 → no interval.

So intervals are [-1,1], [-1,3], [3,5].

Events:

For [-1,1]: events (-1, +1), (2, -1).

For [-1,3]: events (-1, +1), (4, -1).

For [3,5]: events (3, +1), (6, -1).

Sorted events:

(-1, +1), (-1, +1), (2, -1), (3, +1), (4, -1), (6, -1).

Processing:

prev_x = None.

current_active=0.

min_active = infinity.

First event x=-1, delta=+1: prev_x is None. current_active becomes 1. prev_x=-1.

Second event x=-1, delta=+1: current_active becomes 2. prev_x=-1.

Third event x=2, delta=-1: x=2 >-1 → interval [-1, 2) has current_active=2. min_active is 2. current_active becomes 1.

Fourth event x=3, delta=+1: x=3>2 → interval [2,3) has current_active=1. min_active is 1. current_active becomes 2.

Fifth event x=4, delta=-1: x=4>3 → interval [3,4) has current_active=2. min_active remains 1. current_active becomes 1.

Sixth event x=6, delta=-1: x=6>4 → interval [4,6) has current_active=1. min_active remains 1. current_active becomes 0.

After loop, check current_active=0. min_active=0 is possible?

Wait, during processing:

The interval [6, infinity) has current_active=0. So after processing, min_active is min(1, 0) → 0.

But the minimal_active is 0 <=k=0. So feasible.

So p=4 is possible?

But sample input's answer for this case is 3.

Wait, this suggests a problem.

Wait, the sample input's output is 3, but according to this, p=4 is feasible.

What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the code is missing something.

Wait, for p=4, the check returns feasible. But according to the sample input's explanation, p=3 is the correct answer.

This suggests a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let's re-examine the sample input.

Sample input 1:

n=5, k=0. So no deletions.

The array is [2,1,4,5,2].

The answer is p=3.

But according to the binary search approach, p=4 is feasible.

But why?

If p=4 is feasible, then the answer should be 4.

So perhaps there's an error in the reasoning.

Let's see what's happening.

For p=4, the code says it's feasible.

But according to the problem statement, the array must be p-towering after deletions. But k=0, so no deletions.

So the array must have a peak i such that all elements satisfy a_j >=4 - |i-j|.

Let's check for i=3 (0-based j=3, a_j=5).

The elements are:

j=0: 2 >=4 - |3-0|=4-3=1 → 2 >=1 → ok.

j=1: 1 >=4-2=2 → 1 >=2 → no.

So the array cannot be 4-towering. Thus, p=4 is not feasible. But according to the code, it's feasible.

So where is the mistake?

Ah, I think the code's approach is incorrect. Because the code checks if there's an i where the number of j's satisfying a_j >= p - |i-j| is >=m. But when k=0, m=5. So for p=4, the code's check passes, but in reality, it's not possible.

So what's the error in the code's approach?

The code's approach for p=4:

C = number of j's with a_j >=4 → 2 (j=2 and 3).

Then, the forbidden intervals for the other j's (0,1,4).

The code generates intervals for j=0: [-1, 1], j=1: [-1,3], j=4: [3,5].

Then, the code checks if there exists an i where the number of forbidden intervals covering i is <=k=0.

The minimal count of overlapping intervals is 0. For example, i=4:

Check forbidden intervals:

j=0: interval [-1,1] → 4 is not in it.

j=1: interval [-1,3] → 4 is not in it.

j=4: interval [3,5] → 4 is in it.

So the count is 1. Which is greater than k=0.

But according to the code's sweep line, the minimal count is 0.

Where is this?

The code's events are:

For j=0:

interval [-1,1] → events at (-1, +1), (2, -1).

j=1:

interval [-1,3] → events at (-1, +1), (4, -1).

j=4:

interval [3,5] → events at (3, +1), (6, -1).

The events list sorted:

(-1, +1), (-1, +1), (2, -1), (3, +1), (4, -1), (6, -1).

During the sweep:

The first interval is from -infty to -1: current_active=0 → min_active=0.

At x=-1: process both +1's. current_active becomes 2.

Between x=-1 and x=2: current_active=2. So in this interval, any i between -1 and 2 would be covered by 2 intervals. But the code's min_active is 0, which is from the initial step.

Wait, how does the code compute the minimal active?

Let's walk through the code's steps.

prev_x is None.

First event is x=-1, delta=+1:

prev_x is None → no interval to process.

current_active becomes 1.

prev_x = -1.

Next event is x=-1, delta=+1:

x == prev_x → no interval.

current_active becomes 2.

prev_x =-1.

Next event is x=2, delta=-1:

x > prev_x → interval from -1 to 2. current_active is 2 during this interval. So the code checks if 2 < min_active (which is infinity). So min_active becomes 2.

current_active is reduced by 1 → 1.

prev_x=2.

Next event is x=3, delta=+1:

x >2 → interval from 2 to3. current_active=1. So this contributes to min_active as 1. min_active is now 1.

current_active becomes 2.

prev_x=3.

Next event x=4, delta=-1:

x>3 → interval from3 to4. current_active=2 → min_active remains 1.

current_active becomes 1.

prev_x=4.

Next event x=6, delta=-1:

x>4 → interval from4 to6. current_active=1 → min_active remains 1.

current_active becomes 0.

After processing all events, check current_active=0. So the final interval from6 to infinity has current_active=0. So min_active is min(1, 0) → 0.

Thus, code returns that min_active is 0 <=k=0 → feasible.

But in reality, any i must be covered by 0 intervals. But in the intervals generated for p=4, the forbidden intervals are [-1,1], [-1,3], [3,5].

So, for i=5.5 → code's interval [5.5, 5.5] is not covered by any interval. But the code considers i as integer.

Wait, the code is checking for integer i.

Wait, the forbidden intervals are for integer i.

So, in code, the forbidden intervals are [start_j, end_j], which are integer intervals.

So, the code's sweep line is considering integer i's.

But the code's events are generated for the forbidden intervals, which are closed intervals of integers.

So, during the sweep, the code is checking if there's any integer i that is covered by <=k intervals.

So, in the case of p=4 and the sample input:

The code's sweep line found that there exists a point i where the number of forbidden intervals covering i is 0. For example, i=6.

Because after x=6, current_active is 0. So i=6 is not covered by any forbidden interval.

But in the problem, the array is of length 5 (0-based indices 0-4). So i must be an index in the original array after deletions (k=0, so all elements are present). Thus, i can be 0,1,2,3,4.

But the code's approach allows i to be any integer, not just the original indices.

Ah, here's the mistake! The code considers i as any integer, but in the problem, after deletions, the array is a subsequence of the original array. So, the peak i is an index in the modified array, which is a subset of the original array's elements. So, the original array's indices may not be contiguous, but the code's approach allows i to be any integer, which may not correspond to a valid index in the modified array.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

The error is that the code allows i to be any integer, but in reality, i must be one of the indices of the modified array, which is a subset of the original array's indices.

Wait, no. The modified array is a subsequence of the original array. The peak i is a position in the modified array. So, the original array's indices are not contiguous. For example, if the modified array is [4,5], then the indices are 0 and 1 in the modified array, which correspond to original indices 2 and 3. So, the peak i can be 0 or 1 in the modified array. But in the original array's indices, the positions are 2 and 3.

But the code's approach treats i as any integer, including positions not present in the original array. So, the code's approach is incorrect.

This explains why in the sample input, p=4 is considered feasible by the code, but in reality, there's no valid i in the modified array's indices that satisfies the condition.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect because it allows i to be any integer, but in reality, i must be an index in the modified array.

This is a major flaw in the initial approach.

So, how to adjust the approach to account for the fact that i must be an index in the modified array, which is a subset of the original array's elements.

But this seems very difficult. Because the modified array is any subset of the original array with length m =n -k. So the possible i's are the indices of the modified array, which correspond to the positions of the original array's elements that are not deleted.

But considering all possible subsets is impossible for large n.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample input's analysis is missing something.

Wait, for p=4, the code's approach allows i=6, which is not part of the original array. But in the problem, the modified array is the entire array (k=0). So the modified array's indices are 0,1,2,3,4 (original array's indices). So i can be 0-4.

But according to the code's approach, i=5 (or 6) is allowed. But in reality, the peak i must be an index in the modified array. So i can only be 0-4.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

Thus, the binary search approach must be modified to only consider i's that are in the original array's indices (since the modified array's indices are subsets, but the code can't know which indices are kept).

But this complicates things.

Alternative approach: For a given p, the code should check if there exists an i in the original array's indices (0-based) such that the number of intervals covering i is <=k.

But this would require checking all possible i's in the original array.

But for large n, this is O(n) per check, which is acceptable.

But how to compute the number of intervals covering each i in the original array.

This can be done with a prefix sum array.

For example, create an array cnt[i] which is the number of intervals covering i.

Then, for each interval [s, e], increment cnt[s] by 1, decrement cnt[e+1] by 1. Then compute the prefix sum.

But for n up to 2e5, and intervals with s and e up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

So, we need a way to compute the number of intervals covering each i in the original array.

For each i in 0..n-1:

The number of intervals that cover i is the number of j's where a_j <p and i is in [start_j, end_j].

start_j and end_j are computed as j - (p -a_j) +1 and j + (p -a_j) -1.

So for each i, iterate over all j where a_j <p and check if i is in [start_j, end_j].

But this is O(n^2) per check, which is not feasible.

Thus, the code's initial approach is incorrect, and a different approach is needed.

Alternative idea: For each j, the forbidden interval [start_j, end_j] can be checked for overlapping with the original array's indices. So, for each j, compute start_j and end_j. Then, the i's that are allowed are the original array's indices not in any forbidden interval.

But the code's initial approach doesn't restrict i to the original array's indices.

Thus, to fix the code, during the check for a given p, after generating the intervals, we need to check if there exists an i in the original array's indices (0-based) such that the number of intervals covering i is <=k.

So, the modified approach is:

For a given p:

Compute C = number of j with a_j >=p.

If C >=m → feasible.

Else:

Generate all intervals [start_j, end_j] for j where a_j <p.

For each i in 0..n-1:

   count = number of intervals that cover i.

   if C + (number of j where a_j <p and i is not covered by their interval) >=m.

But the number of j where a_j <p and i is not covered is (total_second) - count.

So, the total allowed is C + (total_second - count).

We need this to be >=m → which is equivalent to count <=k.

Thus, the problem reduces to checking if any i in 0..n-1 has count <=k.

So, for each i in 0..n-1:

   count = number of intervals [start_j, end_j] that include i.

   if count <=k → feasible.

Thus, the code needs to check for each i in the original array's indices whether count <=k.

But how to compute this efficiently.

The intervals can be large, so for each j, start_j and end_j can be very far from the original array's indices.

But we need to compute for each i in 0..n-1, the number of intervals that include i.

This can be done with a line sweep.

For each interval [s, e], we can represent it as a range. For each i in 0..n-1, we need to find how many intervals cover i.

This can be done with a prefix sum array.

Steps:

Initialize an array delta of size n+1 with zeros.

For each interval [s, e]:

   if e <0 or s >=n → interval is outside the array.

   else:

       s_clamped = max(s, 0)

       e_clamped = min(e, n-1)

       if s_clamped >e_clamped → interval does not cover any i in 0..n-1.

       else:

           delta[s_clamped] +=1

           delta[e_clamped +1] -=1

Then, compute the prefix sum array. For each i in 0..n-1, the prefix sum is the number of intervals covering i.

If any of these prefix sums is <=k, then p is feasible.

Thus, this approach correctly checks the original array's indices.

Now, this approach is feasible for large n.

Let's test this with sample input 1.

Sample input 1:

n=5, k=0 → m=5.

p=4.

C=2 (j=2,3).

Intervals for j=0,1,4.

For j=0:

start_j=0- (4-2) +1=0-2+1= -1.

end_j=0 + (4-2) -1=0+2-1=1.

interval is [-1, 1].

Clamped to [0, 1].

delta[0] +=1.

delta[2] -=1.

For j=1:

start_j=1 - (4-1) +1=1-3+1= -1.

end_j=1+3-1=3.

interval [-1,3].

Clamped to [0,3].

delta[0] +=1.

delta[4] -=1.

For j=4:
