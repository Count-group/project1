Okay, so I need to solve this problem where three players are playing table tennis in a certain pattern, and I have to determine if the spectator of the first match can also be the spectator of the k-th match. Hmm. Let's try to understand the rules properly.

The setup is that in each match, two players play and one spectates. The next match is determined based on the previous one. The key rule here is that no player can play three times in a row. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, if a player plays two times in a row, then they must sit out the next match. Otherwise, the winner and the spectator from the previous match play next, with the loser spectating.

Wait, the rules are a bit confusing. Let me parse them again.

So the next match depends on the previous. Let's break it down:

Case 1: If a player has played in the previous two matches (i.e., played twice in a row), then in the next match, that player must sit out, and the other two play. So, for example, if the previous two matches had players A and B, then A and B play again, but that's allowed only if they didn't play two in a row before. Wait, no. Wait, the rule is that no player can play three times in a row. So if in the current match, the same two players are playing as the previous two matches, that would mean a player is playing three times in a row. Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.

Suppose the sequence of matches is such that in match i and i+1, the same two players are playing. Then, in each of those matches, each of those players has played in consecutive matches. So if that's the case, then after two consecutive matches where the same two play, the third match must have different players. Or maybe the rule is that a player cannot play three times consecutively. So if a player has played in the last two matches (i and i-1), then he can't play in i+1. Wait, perhaps the rule is that a player can't be in three consecutive matches. So if a player plays in match i-1, i, then he can't play in i+1.

But how does that affect the next match's players?

The rules for determining the next match:

If the previous two matches had the same two players (so the same player played two consecutive times), then the next match must have the other two. Otherwise, the winner and the spectator of the previous match play. Wait, the problem statement says:

The player who plays twice in a row must sit out as a spectator in the next match. Otherwise, the winner and the spectator will play in the next match, while the loser will spectate.

Wait, the first part: "the player who plays twice in a row must sit out." So, if in the current match, a player has played two times in a row (i.e., they were in the previous match as well), then they must sit out the next. So the next match will be between the other two players.

But wait, how can a player have played two times in a row? Because each match is between two players. So for a player to have played two times in a row, they must have been part of two consecutive matches. For example, if match i is A vs B, and match i+1 is A vs C, then player A has played two times in a row. Wait, but the problem states that a player can't play three times in a row. So if a player has played two times in a row (like in i and i+1), then in i+2 they must sit out.

So the next match is determined as follows:

If the current match is played by X and Y, then the next match's players depend on whether any of X or Y played in the previous match (i.e., match i-1). Wait, maybe the rule is that if in the current and previous match, a player was part of both, then they have to sit out the next.

Alternatively, the problem statement's rules are:

If in the current match, a player is playing for the second consecutive time (i.e., they played in the previous match as well), then they must sit out the next. So in that case, the next match is between the two other players.

Otherwise, the next match is between the winner of the current match and the spectator.

Wait, the problem statement says:

To ensure fairness, no player can play three times in a row. The player who plays twice in a row must sit out as a spectator in the next match, which will be played by the other two players. Otherwise, the winner and the spectator will play in the next match, while the loser will spectate.

So the key is:

If a player has played in two consecutive matches (i.e., the previous and current), then that player must sit out the next. So the next match is between the two other players.

Otherwise, the winner of the current match and the spectator (from the current match) play the next match. The loser of the current match becomes the spectator.

Wait, but how do you determine the next players when there's no player who played twice in a row?

Wait, in the case where neither of the current players played in the previous match (which is impossible since each match involves two players), but perhaps the scenario is that the current match's players are the same as the previous, which would mean that each has played two in a row. Then they both must sit out the next? But that's impossible because there are only three players.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that if any of the current players played in the previous match, then that player must not play again in the next match if that would make it three in a row. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me rephrase the rules:

In each match, two players compete, the third spectates.

The next match is determined as follows:

- If a player played in both the previous and current match (so they are in two consecutive matches), then that player must sit out the next. So the next match is played by the other two players (the one who was in the current match but not the previous, and the spectator of the current match).

Wait, perhaps the key is to check whether in the current match, any player is playing two consecutive times. So if the same two players played in the last two matches (i.e., the previous and current match are the same pair), then each of them is in two consecutive matches, so both must sit out the next. But there's only three players. Wait, that can't be. Because if two players play two consecutive matches, then in the next match they can't play, so the third player must play with someone. But there's only three players. Wait, maybe the correct way is: if a player is in two consecutive matches (i.e., played in the previous and current), then in the next match they must sit out. So the next match is between the spectator of the current match and the other player (the one not in the current match).

Wait, perhaps an example would help.

Let's say the first match is between A and B, spectator is C.

In the next match, according to the rules, since neither A nor B played in the previous match (since this is the first match), there's no player who has played two in a row. So the next match is between the winner of the first match (say A) and the spectator (C). The loser B spectates.

So second match is A vs C, spectator B.

Then, for the third match:

We check if any player in the current match (A and C) played in the previous match (A vs C). The previous match was A and B. So in the previous match (match 2), the players were A and C. So the current match (match 3) is between A and C again? Wait, no. Wait, the third match's players depend on whether any of the current players (A and C) were in the previous (match 2) which they were. Wait, the previous match is the same as the current match. Wait, match 2 is A and C. So in the third match, if they play again, then both A and C would have played two consecutive times. So according to the rules, they must sit out. So the next match must be between B (the spectator of match 2) and ... but that's only possible if another player is available. But there are three players. So if A and C played in match 2 and 3, then in match 4, they can't play. So the next match must be between B and ... who? The spectator of match 3 is B? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the way to model this is to track the previous two matches' players, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern that emerges after a certain number of matches, and the spectator sequence has a cycle. Our goal is to find for a given k, whether the spectator in the k-th match can be the same as the first one. The problem says, "can be" so there's a possibility that the spectator can be the same. So we need to find if there exists a sequence of matches where the first spectator is also the k-th spectator.

So the problem is not to determine for all possible sequences, but whether there exists at least one sequence where this is possible.

So for example, in the first test case, k=1, the answer is yes because the first spectator is the first.

In the second test case, k=2, the answer is no. Because in the first match, the spectator is C. For the second match, according to the rules, the next players are the winner (A or B) and the spectator (C). So the next match's players are, say, A and C. The spectator of the second match is B. So the spectator of the second match cannot be C. So regardless of who wins the first match, the spectator of the second match is the loser of the first match, which is either A or B, but not C. So the answer is no.

So the approach here is to model the possible spectators and see for which k the initial spectator can reappear in the k-th position.

Hmm. Let's try to model the possible spectators for each step, given that the first spectator is S.

Let's denote S as the initial spectator. Then, the first match is between the other two players, say A and B.

In the first match, the spectator is S.

The next match (match 2) is determined by the rules. Since it's the first match, there's no previous to it, so the players in the first match are A and B, S is the spectator.

In the first match, since there's no prior matches, the players are A and B. So no one has played two in a row. So the next match is between the winner (say A) and the spectator (S). The loser (B) becomes the spectator for the next match.

So match 2: players are A and S, spectator is B.

Then, for match 3:

We check if any player in the current match (A and S) played in the previous match (A and B). So A was in both matches. So A has played two in a row. So according to the rules, A must sit out the next match. So the next match is between B and S (the other two players). The spectator is A.

So match 3: players B and S, spectator A.

Match 4: Now, check if any of the current players (B and S) played in the previous match (B and S). Wait, no. The previous match (match 3) was B and S. Wait, no, the previous match (match 3) is between B and S, and the previous match (match 2) was A and S. So the current match (match 3) players are B and S. So for the next match (match 4), we need to see if any player in match 3 played in match 2. S was in both, so S has played two consecutive times (matches 2 and 3). So S must sit out. So the next match is between A and B. The spectator is S.

So match 4: players A and B, spectator S. Wait, this brings us back to the initial state. So the spectators are S, B, A, S, B, A, S, etc., repeating every three matches.

Wait, let's see:

Match 1: spectator S.

Match 2: spectator B.

Match 3: spectator A.

Match 4: spectator S.

Match 5: spectator B.

Match 6: spectator A.

So the pattern is S, B, A, S, B, A, etc. So the spectator sequence is a cycle of 3, starting from S. So for k mod 3 equals 1, the spectator is S. So for k=1,4,7,10,..., the answer is YES.

But wait, in the demo input, when k=1e9, which is 10^9, 1e9 mod 3 is (10^9 -1) mod 3 +1 mod 3. Let's compute 1e9 mod 3. Since 10 mod 3 is 1, 10^9 mod 3 is 1^9 mod3 =1. So 1e9 mod3=1. So the answer is YES, which matches the demo output.

So the conclusion is that the spectator can only be the initial spectator S when k mod 3 is 1 (since the cycle is 3). So the answer is YES if k mod3 ==1, else NO.

But wait, how did we arrive at this pattern?

Let me check the steps again:

Match 1: S is spectator.

Match 2: B is spectator.

Match 3: A is spectator.

Match4: S again.

So after three steps, it's back to S.

Thus, for any k where k ≡1 mod 3, the spectator is S. So the answer is YES for k=1,4,7, etc. Otherwise, NO.

But wait, in the demo input, for k=1, output is YES. For k=2, output is NO. For k=333, 333 mod3 is 0. So 333 mod3=0 → which is not 1 → output NO. For k=1e9, which mod3 is 1 → output YES. Which matches the sample.

So the solution is to check if (k-1) is divisible by 3. Wait, no. Wait, 1 mod3 is 1, 4 mod3 is 1, etc. So the condition is k mod3 ==1. So for any k where k mod3 is 1, output YES, else NO.

So the code would be straightforward: read t test cases, for each k, if k mod3 is 1, output YES, else NO.

So for example, for k=1: 1 mod3=1 → YES.

k=2: mod3=2 → NO.

k=3: mod3=0 → NO.

k=4: mod3=1 → YES.

Thus, the code is:

For each test case:

if k %3 ==1 → YES else NO.

But wait, how do we know that the pattern is always S, B, A, S, B, A...? Because the problem states that the answer depends on whether there exists a possible sequence where the spectator is S in the k-th match. So even if there's some other way to arrange the matches leading to S being spectator in k-th, but according to the rules, perhaps the cycle is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the initial choice of who wins each match affects the pattern. But in the problem statement, the players can choose the outcome of each match in a way that allows S to be spectator in the k-th match. So the problem is whether there exists a way to choose the winners such that S can be spectator at position k.

But according to the model we built, the cycle is fixed, regardless of the choices. Or perhaps the choice of the winner can alter the pattern.

Wait, let's re-examine the rules.

Suppose in the first match, players A and B are playing, S is spectator.

The next match's players are determined as follows:

If no player played two consecutive times (which is the case here, since this is the first match), then the next match is between the winner and the spectator. So in this case, the winner of match 1 (could be A or B) and S.

The loser of match 1 becomes the spectator for match 2.

So regardless of who wins match1, the next match's spectator is the loser of match1. So for example, if A wins match1, then match2 is A vs S, and B is spectator. If B wins match1, then match2 is B vs S, and A is spectator. So the spectator of match2 is either A or B. But S can't be the spectator of match2.

So in any scenario, the spectator of match2 is either A or B, not S.

Thus, in the second match, the spectator can't be S.

Then, for match3, depending on how the previous matches went.

Let's suppose match2 is A vs S (if A won match1). So the players in match2 are A and S, spectator is B.

Now, in match2, the players are A and S. To determine the next match, we check if any of them played in the previous match (match1). A was in match1 (players A and B). So A has played two consecutive matches (match1 and match2). Therefore, according to the rules, A must sit out the next match. So the next match (match3) is between B and S. The spectator is A.

Thus, spectator for match3 is A.

Then, match3 players are B and S, spectator A.

For match4: check if any player in match3 played in the previous match (match2). The players in match3 are B and S. In match2, the players were A and S. So S was in both. So S has played two consecutive matches (match2 and 3). So S must sit out match4. So the next match is between A and B. The spectator is S.

Thus, spectator for match4 is S.

So the cycle repeats every three steps: S, B, A, S, B, A, etc.

Wait, but in this scenario, the cycle is three steps. So the spectators are:

1: S

2: B (if A wins match1)

3: A

4: S

5: B

6: A

etc.

So the spectator sequence is S, B, A, S, B, A, ... for this particular path of wins.

But what if in match1, B wins instead?

Then, match2 is B and S, spectator A.

Then, for match3: players B and S. Check if they played in the previous match (match2) which they did. So B was in match1 and match2. So B has played two consecutive matches and must sit out. So match3 is between A and S. The spectator is B.

Then, match3 players are A and S. Check for next match: did any of them play in the previous match (match2)? S was in match2 (B and S). So S has played two consecutive matches (match2 and 3), so must sit out. So match4 is between B and A. The spectator is S.

So spectator sequence would be S, A, B, S, A, B, etc.

Wait, no. Let's walk through this:

Match1: players A and B, spectator S. B wins. So match2 is B vs S, spectator A.

In match2, B and S play. B must have played in match1 and 2, so B has two consecutive matches. So in match3, B must sit out. So the next players are A and S. The spectator is B.

Match3: players A and S, spectator B.

Now, in match3, S was in match2 and 3. So S has played two consecutive matches, so must sit out. So match4 is between B and A. spectator S.

So the sequence is:

1: S

2: A

3: B

4: S

5: A

6: B

So again, the cycle is S, A, B, S, etc. So the spectator sequence is S, then the loser of the first match (A or B), then the next spectator, and so on.

But in both cases, the cycle length is 3. So after three steps, the spectator returns to S.

But in the first scenario, the sequence is S, B, A, S... and in the second scenario, S, A, B, S... So the sequence depends on the initial choices of winners.

But the problem states that we need to determine if there exists any possible sequence of match results such that the spectator of the k-th match is S.

So in some sequences, the spectator can be S in position k, but not in others. But the question is whether there exists any possible way.

For example, if k is 4, then in any scenario, the spectator is S. Because after 3 steps, regardless of the choices made, the spectator returns to S. So for k=4, the answer is YES.

But what about k=3? In the first scenario, the spectator is A. In the second scenario, it's B. So is there a way to have S as spectator at k=3?

In the initial steps, let's see.

In the first scenario:

Match1: S is spectator.

Match2: B is spectator.

Match3: A is spectator.

So S is not spectator here. In another scenario:

Wait, suppose that in the first match, the next match is handled in a different way. But according to the rules, when a player plays two in a row, they must sit out.

Wait, perhaps there's another path that allows S to be spectator earlier.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps can't be altered beyond the first choice. Let's see.

In match1, the players are A and B. The spectator is S.

The next match (match2) must be between the winner (A or B) and S. The loser of match1 becomes the spectator of match2.

So regardless of who wins, the spectator of match2 is the loser of match1. So if A wins, spectator is B. If B wins, spectator is A. So spectator of match2 can't be S.

Then, in match3, depending on the previous steps:

If match2 is between A and S (spectator B), then in match3, the players must be B and S (since A played two consecutive matches). The spectator is A. So S is the player in match3, so spectator is A.

If match2 is between B and S (spectator A), then in match3, players are A and S. So B is spectator.

In either case, the spectator of match3 is either A or B, not S.

So for k=3, there's no possible sequence where S is the spectator.

Then, in match4, the spectator is S again.

So regardless of the choices made in the matches, the spectator sequence must follow a cycle where S appears every 3 steps.

Thus, the answer is YES if and only if k mod 3 == 1.

Thus, the code is straightforward: for each test case, check if k mod 3 is 1. If yes, output YES. Else, NO.

So the code can be written as:

Read t test cases.

For each case:

Read k.

If (k %3 ==1) → print YES else NO.

The demo input:

1 → YES.

2 → NO.

333 → 333 mod3 is 0 → NO.

1e9 → 1e9 mod3 is 1 → YES.

Which matches the sample outputs.

So the code is simple.
