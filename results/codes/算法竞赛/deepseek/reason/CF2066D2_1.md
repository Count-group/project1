Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm. The problem is about counting the number of valid ways to fill in the gaps in a sequence of airplane launches, such that certain conditions are met. Let me read the problem statement carefully again.

So, the building has n floors. Each resident (one per floor) will launch planes until, from their perspective, at least c planes have already been launched. All residents must end up seeing at least c planes. The total number of planes is m. Some of the entries in the sequence are 0, which we have to replace with floor numbers. The answer is the number of valid ways to do this, modulo 1e9+7.

First, let's understand the conditions. When a resident from floor i launches a plane, all floors 1 to i see it. So for a resident on floor i, the count of planes they've seen is the number of planes launched by floors >= i. Because any plane launched by floor j (j >= i) will be visible to i's residents. Wait, no. Wait, when a person on floor j throws a plane, all floors 1..j can see it. So for the resident on floor i, the planes they see are all the planes thrown by floors >= i. Because a person on floor i can see all planes thrown by floors i, i+1, ..., n. Because when a plane is thrown from floor j >= i, it's in the 1..j range, so i is part of that. Wait, no: the floors are numbered from 1 to n, bottom to top. So when a person on floor j throws a plane, it's visible to all floors from 1 up to j. So the resident on floor i (i <= j) can see it. So the resident on floor i will see all planes thrown by floors >= i (since j >= i implies i is in 1..j). Wait, no: for example, if a plane is thrown from floor 3, then floors 1, 2, 3 can see it. So for resident on floor 2, they can see that plane. So any plane thrown from a floor j >= i will be visible to i. So the total number of planes visible to resident i is the number of planes thrown from floors i, i+1, ..., n.

So each resident i must have at least c planes thrown from floors >= i. Because once they themselves have thrown a plane, if their count (the planes thrown by their floor and higher) is >= c, they stop. So the total number of planes in the sequence for each i's perspective must be >= c. Also, the total number of planes m is the sum of all planes thrown by each resident. But since each resident stops once their count reaches c, the total number of planes is exactly the sum over all floors i of the number of planes they threw, but each floor's contribution is exactly the minimum of the number of times they could throw before their count reaches c. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the resident on floor i will launch planes until, from their perspective, at least c planes have been launched. So the resident i will stop launching when the total planes thrown by floors >=i (including their own) is >= c. So the resident i can throw some number of planes. Let's denote for each floor i, the number of planes they actually throw as x_i. Then, x_i can be 0 to k, but subject to the condition that after all the planes are thrown (in the sequence), the sum of x_j for j >= i must be >= c. Because that's the condition that the resident i's perspective is that enough planes have been launched. Also, each x_i is the number of times the resident i appears in the sequence. Because each time a resident throws a plane, it's in the sequence.

Wait, but the sequence is ordered. The order matters because when a resident throws a plane, it's added to all lower floors' counts. So, for example, if a resident i throws a plane early in the sequence, that contributes to the counts of all floors <=i. But the resident i's own count (planes from >=i) includes their own planes, but the order in which they are thrown affects when they decide to stop.

But the problem states that all residents must have, by the end, at least c planes in their perspective. So the sum for each i of x_j for j >=i must be >=c.

But how do the x_i's relate to the sequence of planes? The x_i is the number of times the resident i appears in the sequence. Because each element in the sequence is a resident (after replacing the 0s), and x_i is the count of that resident in the sequence.

So the first condition is that for each i, sum_{j >=i} x_j >= c. Second, the sum of all x_i's must be exactly m.

Moreover, the sequence must be ordered in such a way that when a resident i throws a plane, it's only possible if up to that point, the number of planes thrown by j >=i (including any previous ones) plus the current one is less than c. Because once that count reaches c, the resident i will not throw any more planes. Wait, no. Wait, each time a resident throws a plane, the count for their floor and all higher floors (i's perspective) includes all planes up to that point. So when the resident throws a plane, it's added to their own count, but the next time they throw, it's only allowed if, after adding that plane, their count is still less than c. Wait, no. Wait, the resident i will stop throwing planes when their perspective count (sum of x_j for j >=i) is >=c. So the resident i can only throw planes until that sum reaches c. But the sequence is processed in order, so each time a resident throws a plane, we have to check whether their current count (sum up to that point) has already reached c. If it has, they can't throw any more.

So the sequence must be such that, for each occurrence in the sequence where the resident is i, the sum of all previous occurrences (including this one) in the sequence of residents j >=i must be <= c. Wait, no. Wait, the resident i will launch a plane only if, before that launch, the sum of all planes from j >=i in the previous steps is less than c. Because when they launch, the sum (including their own plane) increases by 1. If the sum before is >=c, they can't launch anymore. So for each occurrence of i in the sequence, the sum of all planes j >=i that were launched before (including any previous instances of i) must be < c. Because that's the only way the resident i would agree to launch that plane.

So the problem is not just about the x_i's satisfying sum_{j >=i} x_j >=c and sum x_i =m, but also about the order in which the planes are launched. The order must ensure that whenever a resident i is launching a plane, the number of planes they've launched so far (including this one) plus the planes from higher floors (i+1 to n) launched so far is <= c. Wait, no: because the sum for resident i is the sum of x_j for j >=i. But during the sequence, each time a resident i is chosen to launch a plane, that contributes to their x_i, which affects all j <=i. Wait, no. The x_i is the count of times i appears in the sequence. So the sum for j >=i is the number of times any resident j >=i appears in the sequence. So for resident i's perspective, their count is the number of planes in the sequence that are >=i. So whenever a resident i is chosen to launch a plane, that counts towards their own sum (since j >=i includes i). So if, up to and including that point, the sum of j >=i in the sequence is s, then s must be <=c, because once s reaches c, the resident i can't launch any more planes. But since the resident i is launching this plane, the sum up to that step (including this plane) would be s. So before this plane is launched, the sum must have been s-1. So for the plane to be launched, s-1 must be < c. Therefore, s <= c. But since after all planes are launched, s must be >=c for each i. So for each i, the sum of x_j for j >=i is exactly c, but wait no. Because the resident stops launching once the sum reaches c. So after the first time the sum reaches c, they can't launch anymore. So the sum for i is exactly c. Because once it reaches c, they can't launch any more. Wait, but maybe other residents could have launched planes that contribute to i's sum. For example, if resident i+1 launches a plane, that contributes to i's sum (since j >=i includes i+1). So even if resident i has x_i=0, if residents higher than i launch enough planes, then their sum can reach c.

But each resident's own launching is allowed as long as their own sum hasn't yet reached c. So for the sequence, whenever a resident i is chosen to launch a plane, the sum of planes launched by j >=i up to that point (including this plane) must be <=c. And by the end, the sum for each i must be exactly >=c. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says that by the end of the day, each resident's perspective has at least c planes. So the sum for each i is >=c. But during the sequence, each time a resident is chosen, the sum of their j >=i up to that point (including that plane) must be <=c. Because once it reaches c, they can't launch anymore. So the sequence must be such that for each occurrence of resident i in the sequence, the sum of all j >=i planes in the sequence up to and including that occurrence is <=c. But by the end, the sum must be >=c for all i. So for each i, the sum of j >=i in the entire sequence is >=c. So combining these, for each i, the sum is exactly c, because during the sequence, once it reaches c, no more planes can be launched by j >=i. Wait, but other j's higher than i can still launch planes. Because when a resident j >i launches a plane, it contributes to i's sum. So for example, suppose i=2, j=3. If j=3 launches a plane, that counts towards i=2's sum. So even after i=2's sum reaches c, if j=3 launches a plane, that's allowed as long as j=3's own sum hasn't reached c. But that plane would still contribute to i=2's sum, which is already >=c. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the resident i stops launching when their own sum (sum of j >=i) reaches c. But other residents j (j >i) can continue launching as long as their sum (sum of k >=j) hasn't reached c. So for example, after i's sum reaches c, j >i can still launch planes, which would increase i's sum beyond c. But the problem says that in the end, each resident's sum must be >=c. So it's possible for the sum to be more than c. But during the sequence, the resident i will stop launching once their sum reaches c. So any planes launched by i must be when their sum is <c. But planes launched by j >i can still be added even if i's sum is >=c. So the sum for i can be more than c. So the sum for i is at least c. But for j >=i, when they launch a plane, their sum (sum of k >=j) must be <c at the time of launch. So for example, j>i can have their sum (sum of k >=j) up to c. But j can only launch a plane if before that launch, their sum (sum of k >=j) was <c.

So the constraints are:

For each occurrence of a resident r in the sequence:

At the time of the occurrence (before it's added), the sum of all previous occurrences in the sequence of residents >=r must be <c. After adding this occurrence, the sum becomes <=c.

But after all m planes, for each resident i, the sum of j >=i in the sequence must be >=c.

Moreover, the sum of all x_i (the count of each resident in the sequence) is m.

Now, the problem is to fill in the 0s in the given sequence a_1, ..., a_m with 1..n, such that all the constraints are satisfied.

The answer is the number of such valid sequences.

Hmm. This seems complicated. Let's think about how to model this.

First, we need to process the sequence step by step. For each position in the sequence, if it's a 0, we can choose any valid resident (based on the constraints up to that point) to fill it. Otherwise, the resident is fixed, and we must check that it's allowed.

But considering that n and m are up to 100 and 1e4, respectively, but per test case m is up to 1e4, and there are 1e4 test cases, but the sum of m across test cases is 1e4, then perhaps a dynamic programming approach is feasible.

But the state of the DP would need to track, for each step, the counts of the sum for each resident. But that's impossible for n up to 100. Hmm. Alternative approaches.

Wait, perhaps we can model the state based on the current required minimum floor. Let's think of it in terms of the constraints. For each step, the possible choices of residents must be >= a certain floor. Because when a resident r is chosen, all residents >=r must have their sum (so far) <c.

Wait, maybe another way: For each step k in 1..m, the sequence up to step k must satisfy that for each step l <=k, if a_l = r, then the sum of all a_1..a_l that are >=r is <=c.

But how to model this. Let's think of the sequence step by step. For each step, after processing the first k elements, we can track for each floor i, the number of times a resident j >=i has appeared in the first k elements.

But tracking all these counts would be impossible for n up to 100. So that's 100 variables, which is 100 dimensions. For m up to 1e4, that's not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each resident i, the sum of j >=i in the entire sequence must be s_i >=c. Also, during the sequence, whenever a resident r is added, the sum s_r (sum of j >=r) up to that point must be <c before adding. So after adding, s_r becomes s_r_prev +1 <=c. So the sum for r after this step is s_r_prev +1 <=c. But in the end, s_r must be >=c. So for each r, the sum s_r in the entire sequence must be exactly c. Because when the first time s_r reaches c, any further additions to j >=r would cause s_r to exceed c. Wait, no. Because if j>r, adding j would contribute to s_r. So for example, if r=2, and after some steps, s_2 is c. Then, if a resident 3 is added, s_2 increases by 1 (since 3 >=2), making s_2 = c+1. But that's allowed as long as resident 3's own sum (s_3) hasn't reached c. So in the end, s_r can be greater than c.

Wait, but the problem states that in the end, each resident must have s_i >=c. So s_i can be >=c. However, during the process, whenever a resident r is added, the sum s_r up to that point (including this addition) must be <=c. Because before adding, s_r was <c, and adding 1 (since r is >=r) increases s_r by 1. So the sum after adding must be <=c.

Wait, no. Wait, when we add a resident r, the sum s_r_prev is the sum of j >=r in the first k-1 elements. Adding r increases this sum by 1, so s_r_new = s_r_prev +1. For this addition to be allowed, s_r_prev must be <c. So s_r_new <=c. So after this addition, s_r_new <=c. But in the end, the sum s_r must be >=c. Therefore, for each resident r, the sum s_r (sum of j >=r in the entire sequence) is exactly c. Because during the sequence, when a resident r is added, the sum s_r can't exceed c. But in the end, s_r must be at least c. So s_r must be exactly c. Because any addition to s_r can't make it exceed c. So for each r, sum_{j >=r} x_j =c.

Wait, that's a key insight! Because during the sequence, whenever a resident r is added, the sum of j >=r up to that point (including this addition) is <=c. So in the entire sequence, the sum of j >=r is exactly c, because otherwise, after the last addition to j >=r, the sum would be less than c, which would require that the resident r (and others >=r) could launch more planes. But the problem states that in the end, the sum is at least c. So the sum must be exactly c for each r. Wait, no. Because other residents j >=r can contribute to the sum after r's sum has reached c. For example, if r=2 and j=3. Suppose j's sum (sum of j >=3) is allowed to be added even after r=2's sum is c. Because adding j=3 contributes to r=2's sum. So in this case, the sum for r=2 would be c + x_j, where x_j is the number of times j=3 and higher are added after r=2's sum reaches c. So the sum for r=2 could be more than c. But according to the problem's end condition, that's allowed. However, during the sequence, any addition of j >=r (including j=r) must have sum up to that point (after the addition) <=c. Wait, no. Let me re-express.

Each time a resident r is added to the sequence, the sum of j >=r in the sequence up to that point (including this addition) must be <=c. Because the resident r would not add the plane if their sum (j >=r) is already >=c. So when r is added, the sum of j >=r up to that step must be <=c. But after all steps, the sum of j >=r must be >=c. So the sum can be between c and c + ...? Wait, no. Because once the sum of j >=r reaches c, any subsequent additions to j >=r (like adding a resident r or higher) would require that the sum after addition is <=c. But that's impossible, because the sum before adding is >=c, so adding 1 would make it >=c+1. Therefore, once the sum of j >=r reaches c, no more residents r or higher can be added. Because adding them would require that the sum of j >=r up to that point (before adding) is <c. But if the sum is already c, adding a resident >=r would make the sum c+1, which is invalid.

So this suggests that for any r, the sum of j >=r in the entire sequence is exactly c. Because once it reaches c, no more additions are allowed. But wait, what about adding a resident j >r? For example, j = r+1. When adding j, the sum of j >=j is the sum of j and higher. So adding j (r+1) would check if the sum of j >= (r+1) is <c. So even if r's sum has reached c, adding j (r+1) is allowed as long as the sum of j >= (r+1) is <c.

But when we add j=r+1, it contributes to the sum of j >=r (since j is >=r). So for r's sum, this addition increases it by 1, which could take it beyond c. But that's not allowed, because when adding j=r+1, the sum of j >=r+1 must be <c. But j's sum is allowed to be added even if r's sum is >=c. Because the check for j=r+1 is based on the sum of j >=r+1, not the sum of j >=r.

Ah, so here's the key. When adding a resident j, the check is based on the sum of j >=k, where k is the resident j. So for the resident j, the sum is the count of all residents >=j in the sequence up to that point. So when adding j, the sum of >=j must be <c before the addition. After adding, it becomes sum_prev +1 <=c.

So, for example, if j=3 (n=3), then the sum for j=3 must be <c before adding. After adding, sum becomes sum_prev +1 <=c.

But adding j=3 also contributes to the sum for j=2 and j=1. Because j=3 >=2 and >=1. So when adding j=3, the sum for j=2 and j=1 are increased by 1. But the check is only on the sum for j=3 (since that's the resident we're adding). So even if j=2's sum is already c, adding j=3 is allowed as long as j=3's sum is <c.

This complicates things. So the sum for each j can be more than c, but only if those contributions come from residents higher than j. So the sum for j is the sum of x_i for i >=j. And the constraints are:

For each occurrence of j in the sequence, the sum of x_i (i >=j) in the sequence up to and including that occurrence must be <=c. However, in the end, the sum for j must be >=c. But during the sequence, adding j can only happen if the sum up to that point (before adding) for j's sum is <c. So after adding, it's <=c.

Wait, this seems contradictory. Because when you add j, you check that the sum of i >=j up to that point (before adding) is <c. Then, adding j increases it by 1. So after adding, sum is <=c. But in the end, the sum for j must be >=c. Therefore, for j's sum in the entire sequence, it must be exactly c. Because:

Each time j is added, the sum (before adding) for j's sum is s_prev <c. After adding, s_prev +1 <=c. So in the entire sequence, the sum for j's sum is s_j. So:

For all steps where j is added: s_prev <c. So the total sum s_j is the sum of all such increments. Since each time j is added, s_prev increases by 1, and s_prev starts at 0. So after the first addition, s_prev becomes 1. After the second, 2, etc. So the maximum possible s_j is c. Because once s_prev reaches c-1, adding j would make it c. After that, you can't add j anymore. But other residents higher than j can still be added, contributing to j's sum. Wait, no. Adding a resident higher than j (like j+1) contributes to j's sum. So even if j's sum is already c, adding j+1 will increase j's sum to c+1. But according to the constraints, when adding j+1, the sum for j+1's sum (which is the sum of i >=j+1) must be <c before adding. The sum for j's sum is allowed to be >=c. So this is possible.

So j's sum can be greater than c, but the sum for j+1's sum must be exactly c.

Wait, but j's sum can be greater than c. For example, when j=2 and j+1=3. Suppose the sum for j=3's sum is c. Then, adding j+1=3 would be allowed as long as the sum for 3's sum is <c. But once the sum for 3's sum is c, you can't add 3 anymore. But adding 3's sum can be c, and then adding higher floors (but there's no higher floors). So j=2's sum can be the sum of x_2 + x_3. Since x_3 is c (sum of i>=3 is c), then x_3 =c. x_2 can be up to c. Wait, no. Because when adding j=2, the sum of i >=2 is checked. So for each addition of j=2, the sum of i >=2 (which includes x_2 and x_3) must be <c. But x_3's sum is exactly c, because when adding x_3's elements, their sum must reach exactly c. So if x_3's sum is c, then when j=2 is added, the sum of i >=2 (x_2's current count plus x_3's sum) must be <c. But x_3's sum is already c. So the sum of i >=2 is x_2_prev + c. But for j=2 to be added, this must be <c. So x_2_prev +c <c. Which implies x_2_prev <0. Which is impossible. Therefore, once x_3's sum is c, j=2 can't be added anymore. So x_2's sum is the number of times j=2 was added before x_3's sum reached c. But x_3's sum is exactly c. So j=2's sum is x_2, and x_2 +x_3 (sum of i >=2) must be >=c. But when adding j=2, the sum of i >=2 (x_2_prev + x_3_prev) must be <c. So when x_3_prev is s, x_2_prev is t. Then, t + s <c. Then, after adding j=2, t+1 + s <=c. But x_3_prev can be up to c. So if s is c, then t+1 +s would be t+1 +c, which is >=c+1. But that's not allowed. So this implies that j=3's sum must be added after j=2's sum. Or perhaps j=3's sum is added first. So this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum for each j must be exactly c. Let's think again.

Suppose the sum for j is s_j. Then:

For each occurrence of j in the sequence, before adding it, the sum of i >=j in the sequence is s_prev. So s_prev <c. After adding j, it's s_prev+1 <=c.

But other j's can add to s_j. For example, adding j+1 increases s_j by 1. But when adding j+1, the sum for j+1 (s_{j+1}_prev) must be <c. So after adding j+1, s_{j+1}_prev +1 <=c. So s_{j+1} is exactly c. But for j's sum s_j, it's the sum of s_{j}, s_{j+1}, ..., s_n}.

Wait, no. The sum s_j is the total number of times residents >=j are in the sequence. So s_j = sum_{k >=j} x_k. Where x_k is the number of times k appears in the sequence. So s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

So s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

But from the constraints, for each j, s_j >=c. Also, when adding j, the sum s_j_prev (before adding j) must be <c. So for each j, the number of times j is added (x_j) is such that during each addition of j, the sum s_j_prev (x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev) must be <c. After adding j, the sum becomes x_j_prev +1 + s_{j+1}_prev <=c. But after all additions, s_j >=c.

But s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

Hmm. This seems like a recursive problem. Let's consider starting from the highest floor and working down.

For j =n: s_j is the number of times j appears in the sequence. Because s_{j+1} is zero (since j is n). So s_n =x_n.

But s_n must be >=c. But also, each time j=n is added, the sum s_j_prev (x_n_prev) must be <c. So the number of times j=n can be added is exactly c. Because each addition increments x_n from 0 to 1, ..., up to c. But when x_n reaches c, adding it again would require s_j_prev =c <c is false. So x_n can be at most c. But wait, the sum s_n must be >=c, but the x_n (s_n) must be <=c. So s_n must be exactly c. Because otherwise, x_n can't reach >=c if it's added in the sequence. Because the sum s_j_prev must be <c before adding. So x_n can be at most c, and in the end, s_n >=c. So s_n must be exactly c.

Similarly, for j =n-1, s_{n-1} =x_{n-1} + s_n =x_{n-1} +c. But s_{n-1} must be >=c. But x_{n-1} can be zero. So s_{n-1} >=c is always true as long as c >=c. Which it is. So x_{n-1} can be any number such that during each addition of j =n-1, the sum s_j_prev (x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev) must be <c.

But s_n_prev is the sum for j=n up to that point. Which for j=n, the sum is exactly c. So when adding j =n-1, the sum s_{n-1}_prev (x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev) must be <c. But s_n_prev is the sum of j>=n up to that point. Since j=n's sum is exactly c, s_n_prev can be up to c. But when adding j =n-1, the sum s_{n-1}_prev is x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev. But s_n_prev is the sum of j >=n in the sequence up to that point. Which is exactly c, because j=n's sum must be exactly c. So x_{n-1}_prev + c must be <c. Which implies x_{n-1}_prev <0. Which is impossible. So j =n-1 can't be added at all. Because s_n_prev is c, and x_{n-1}_prev is zero (before any additions). So x_{n-1}_prev +c =0 +c >=c. So adding j=n-1 is impossible. So x_{n-1} must be zero.

Wait, this seems contradictory. What's wrong here?

Wait, when adding j=n-1, the sum s_{n-1}_prev is x_{n-1}_prev (number of times j=n-1 has been added before) plus s_n_prev (the sum of j>=n up to that point). But s_n_prev is the sum of j>=n up to that point. Which is the sum of j=n's appearances up to that step.

But j=n's sum is exactly c. So when adding j=n-1, the step must be before all the j=n's additions. Or perhaps not. Because the sequence can have any order of additions, as long as the constraints are met.

Wait, but j=n's sum must be exactly c, and each addition of j=n must be when the sum s_n_prev (the sum up to that point for j=n) is <c. So j=n can be added exactly c times, and all of their additions must be in steps where the sum s_n_prev is 0,1,...,c-1.

Now, when adding j=n-1, the sum s_{n-1}_prev is x_{n-1}_prev (number of times j=n-1 added so far) plus s_n_prev (sum of j>=n up to that point). So if during the addition of j=n-1, the sum s_n_prev can be anything between 0 and c. For example, suppose j=n-1 is added before any j=n. Then s_n_prev is 0. So x_{n-1}_prev (0) +0 <c. So allowed. So j=n-1 can be added once. Then, after adding j=n-1, the sum s_{n-1} becomes 1, but s_n is still 0. Then, adding j=n would have s_n_prev 0, so allowed. So j=n can be added c times. Then, the sum s_{n-1} is 1 + c. Which is >=c. So j=n-1 can be added once, and j=n c times.

So in this scenario, x_{n-1} is 1, which is allowed. So my earlier reasoning was incorrect.

So the sum s_{n-1} is x_{n-1} + s_n =x_{n-1} +c. Since s_{n-1} must be >=c, which it is as long as x_{n-1} >=0. But during the addition of j=n-1, the sum s_{n-1}_prev (x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev) must be <c. For example, when adding j=n-1 for the first time, x_{n-1}_prev is 0, s_n_prev is the sum of j>=n up to that point. But if j=n-1 is added before any j=n, then s_n_prev is 0. So 0 +0 <c: allowed. After adding, x_{n-1}_prev becomes 1, s_n_prev remains 0. Then, adding j=n c times would each time increment s_n_prev from 0 to c. Then, sum s_{n-1} =1 +c >=c. So it's allowed.

So this shows that x_{n-1} can be non-zero.

Thus, the previous conclusion that x_j for j <n must be zero is incorrect. So my initial approach was wrong.

This indicates that the problem is more complex than previously thought. Let's think of another approach.

Let's model the constraints for each j in terms of their x_j and the x_{j+1}, ..., x_n.

For j from n downto 1:

s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

Each time j is added to the sequence, the sum x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev must be <c. Here, x_j_prev is the number of times j was added before this step, and s_{j+1}_prev is the sum of x_{j+1} ... x_n up to that step.

But since s_{j+1} is the sum of x_{j+1} ... x_n, which is exactly the sum of their x's. So the order in which these are added affects the possible x_j.

But this seems recursive. So for j, the maximum x_j can be is the number of times we can add j such that x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev <c. But s_{j+1}_prev is the sum of x_{j+1} up to that step.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternative approach: since the sum s_j for each j is x_j + s_{j+1}, and each time j is added, x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev <c. Also, s_j >=c.

But s_j =x_j + s_{j+1} >=c. So x_j >= c - s_{j+1}.

But s_{j+1} can be up to c * (n -j) (if each of j+1 to n have s_k =c). But no, because s_{j+1} = x_{j+1} + s_{j+2}, and s_{j+1} can be up to c + s_{j+2} (if x_{j+1} is c). But this seems messy.

But wait, for j from n down to 1:

s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

For j=n, s_n =x_n, and s_n >=c. But each addition of j=n requires that x_n_prev <c. So x_n can be at most c. And since s_n >=c, x_n must be exactly c.

Then, for j=n-1:

s_{n-1} =x_{n-1} + s_n =x_{n-1} +c. Which must be >=c. So x_{n-1} >=0. But each addition of j=n-1 requires that x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev <c. Here, s_n_prev is the sum of x_n up to that step (before adding j=n-1).

But x_n is exactly c. So s_n_prev is the sum of x_n up to the step before adding j=n-1. Wait, but when adding j=n-1, the x_n_prev can be anything from 0 to c. Because the addition of j=n-1 can be before any of the j=n additions.

For example, j=n-1 can be added when x_n_prev is 0. Then x_{n-1}_prev is 0, s_n_prev is 0. So 0 +0 <c: allowed. After adding j=n-1, x_{n-1} becomes 1. Then, j=n can be added c times. So s_{n-1} =1 +c >=c.

But if j=n-1 is added after some j=n additions, then s_n_prev could be some value k (1 <=k <=c), and x_{n-1}_prev could be some m. Then, the sum m +k <c must hold. So for example, if j=n-1 is added once after j=n has been added k times. So m=0 (first addition of j=n-1), k=3. Then 0+3 <c. So c must be greater than 3.

So x_{n-1} can be added as long as x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev <c for each addition. But s_n_prev is the sum of j=n up to that step. Which is the number of j=n additions made before this step.

So for j=n-1, the maximum possible x_{n-1} is the number of times that the sum (x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev) <c. But this depends on the order in which j=n and j=n-1 are added.

This seems to suggest that the x_j's are interdependent and their allowed values are not straightforward.

Given the complexity, perhaps we should model the problem using dynamic programming, tracking the current state of s_j for each j. But for n=100, this is impossible. Alternative approaches.

Another observation: since each addition of j contributes to all s_i for i <=j. But the constraints are on the s_j for each j when adding j.

So, perhaps the sequence must be such that for each j, the x_j is the number of times j is added before the sum of j's s_j reaches c. But this is not directly helpful.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as each j must be added exactly x_j times, with x_j <=c, and the sum of x_j's must be m. But this is not sufficient.

But the key insight is that for each j, the sum of x_k for k >=j must be >=c, and for each addition of j, the sum of x_k for k >=j up to that point must be <c.

Wait, but the sum of x_k for k >=j up to that point is the sum of x_j_prev (number of times j was added before) plus the sum of x_{j+1}, x_{j+2}, ..., x_n up to that point. Which is s_j_prev.

But since x_{j+1} can be added after j's additions, this complicates things.

Perhaps we can model the problem as follows:

For each j, the sum s_j must be exactly c. Because during the sequence, the sum s_j can't exceed c when adding j. But adding higher j's can contribute to s_j. Wait, no. For example, when adding j+1, it contributes to s_j. But when adding j+1, the sum s_{j+1}_prev must be <c. But s_j is s_{j+1} + x_j. So s_j can be greater than c if x_j is large enough. But how?

This seems to be the crux of the problem. Let's try to find a way to model this.

Alternative approach:

The constraints for the sequence are:

1. For each j in 1..n: sum_{k >=j} x_k >=c.

2. For each occurrence of j in the sequence, the sum of x_k for k >=j up to and including that occurrence must be <=c.

Additionally, the total sum of x_1 + ... + x_n =m.

But how to model this. The first condition is about the total sum for each j. The second condition is about the order of the sequence.

The problem is to count the number of sequences of length m, consisting of residents 1..n (with possibly some fixed entries), such that:

- For each j, the total number of occurrences in the sequence (x_j) plus the sum of x_{j+1} + ... +x_n} >=c.

- For each occurrence of j in the sequence, the number of times j and higher floors have occurred up to and including that occurrence is <=c.

But the first condition is a consequence of the second, because each time j is added, the sum up to that point is <=c, but after all additions, the sum must be >=c. So the sum must be exactly c.

Wait, let's suppose that for a particular j, the sum of x_k for k >=j is s_j. Then, during the sequence, each time j is added, the sum up to that point (including j) is <=c. So the sum s_j can be at most c. But the first condition requires s_j >=c. So s_j must be exactly c.

But wait, what about when adding higher j's. For example, adding j+1 after j's sum has reached c. Adding j+1 increases j's sum by 1. So s_j becomes c+1, which would violate the first condition. But according to the problem statement, the first condition requires s_j >=c. So this is allowed. But according to the second condition, when adding j+1, the sum of k >=j+1 up to that point must be <=c. So this is allowed.

But then, the sum s_j can be greater than c. So the earlier conclusion is incorrect.

This is very confusing. Let's try a small example.

Demo Input 1:

3 2 4

0 0 0 0

Output 6.

Possible sequences are listed. Let's take one, like [1,1,3,3].

x_1=2, x_2=0, x_3=2.

sum for j=3: x_3=2 >=c=2. Okay.

sum for j=2: x_2 + x_3=0+2=2 >=2. Okay.

sum for j=1: x_1 +x_2 +x_3=2+0+2=4 >=2. Okay.

Now, check the sequence:

First two 1's:

When adding first 1: sum for j=1 is 0 before adding. sum after is 1 <=2. Okay.

Adding second 1: sum before is 1 <2. sum after 2 <=2.

Adding 3: sum for j=3 before adding is 0 <2. sum after 1 <=2.

Adding 3 again: sum for j=3 before adding is 1 <2. sum after 2 <=2.

All constraints are met.

Now, sum for j=1 is 4 >=2. sum for j=2 is 2 >=2. sum for j=3 is 2 >=2.

So the sum for j=1 is 4, which is greater than c=2. So the sum s_j can be greater than c.

But how is this possible? Because when adding j=3, the sum for j=3 is checked. The sum for j=1 is not directly checked when adding j=3. So j=3's addition increases j=1's sum, but the constraints on j=1's sum are only that it's >=c in the end.

So the sum s_j can be greater than c. But during the sequence, each time j is added, the sum of j's sum up to that point (including that addition) must be <=c. So for j=1, the sum s_1 is the total number of residents in the sequence, since all are >=1. In the example, s_1 is 4. But during the sequence, the additions of 1's are allowed as long as their sum up to that point (sum of >=1) is <=c=2.

Wait, no. When adding a 1, the sum of j >=1 up to that point (after adding) is <=c=2. So adding the first 1: sum is 1 <=2. Second 1: sum is 2 <=2. Then adding 3: sum of j >=3 is 1. Then adding 3 again: sum is 2.

But the sum for j=1 is 4, which is 2+2. But how did that happen?

Ah, because when adding 3's, it contributes to j=1's sum. But during those additions, the constraints are only checked for j=3's sum.

So the sum for j=1 is allowed to be larger than c, as long as the additions of j=1's are done while their sum (sum of j >=1) is <=c.

But in the example, after adding the two 1's, the sum for j=1 is 2. Adding the two 3's adds 2 to the sum for j=1. So the total sum is 4. But when adding the 3's, the sum for j=1 is not checked. Only the sum for j=3 is checked. So the sum for j=1 can exceed c.

So the sum s_j can be larger than c, but the sum s_j must be >=c. And for each addition of j, the sum s_j up to that point (including the addition) must be <=c.

This makes the problem more complex.

So the constraints are:

For each j in 1..n:

sum_{k >=j} x_k >=c.

For each occurrence of j in the sequence, the sum_{k >=j} x_k up to and including that occurrence is <=c.

So the sum s_j = sum_{k >=j} x_k must be >=c, and for each occurrence of j in the sequence, the sum up to that point (including) is <=c.

But how can s_j be greater than c? Only if some of the x_k for k >j are added after j's sum reaches c.

For example, in the demo input, after adding two 1's (sum for j=1 is 2), adding two 3's adds to j=1's sum, making it 4. So the sum for j=1 is 4 >=c=2. But during the additions of the 3's, the sum for j=1's sum is 2, then 3, then 4. But since those additions are for j=3, the sum for j=3's sum is checked, not j=1's. So this is allowed.

So the sum for j can be larger than c, but during additions of j, the sum up to that point (including) must be <=c.

So the main constraints are:

- For each j, the sum s_j >=c.

- For each occurrence of j in the sequence, the sum of k >=j up to and including that occurrence is <=c.

So the problem is to count the number of sequences of length m with certain entries filled, such that these two conditions are met.

Now, how to model this.

The approach is to process the sequence step by step, and for each step, track for each j the number of times k >=j have been added so far. But this is not feasible for n=100 and m=1e4.

Alternative idea: Since for each occurrence of j, the sum of k >=j up to that step is <=c, and after all steps, this sum is >=c. But how can this sum be >=c if each addition of j ensures it's <=c? Because when adding j, the sum after is <=c. But other additions of k >j can contribute to j's sum.

For example, adding k>j after adding j's full c steps. So j's sum is c, and adding k>j increases it. But in this case, the sum for j can exceed c.

But the initial sum for j after all additions of j is c, and then adding k>j increases it.

But the sum s_j must be >=c. Which is satisfied if j's sum reaches c and then any additions of k>j.

So the key is:

For each j, the sum of k >=j in the sequence must be >=c.

But the sum of k >=j can be broken into x_j + sum_{k>j} x_k.

But during the sequence, when adding j, the sum x_j_prev + sum_{k>j} x_k_prev must be <c. Here, sum_{k>j} x_k_prev is the sum of x_k up to that step (for k>j).

Thus, for j's x_j, each addition of j must satisfy x_j_prev + sum_{k>j} x_k_prev <c.

But sum_{k>j} x_k_prev can vary as other k's are added.

But how to model this.

Let's think recursively. For each j from n downto 1:

The sum of k >=j in the sequence is s_j =x_j + s_{j+1}.

For j's x_j, each addition of j must have x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev <c. Where s_{j+1}_prev is the sum of k >=j+1 up to that step.

But s_{j+1} can be >=c, but x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev must be <c for each addition of j.

But s_{j+1} is the sum of x_{j+1} + s_{j+2}.

So for j, during the additions of j, the sum s_{j+1}_prev can be anything, but x_j_prev must be such that x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev <c.

But how can we model this? It depends on the order of the additions.

This seems very complex. Alternative approach: the problem requires that the sum of k >=j in the sequence is >=c. But during the sequence, when adding j, the sum up to that point (k >=j) is <=c. So the sum s_j can be written as s_j = a_j + b_j, where a_j is the sum of k >=j added before the first addition of k >j, and b_j is the sum added by k >j.

But this is not helpful.

Alternative idea: the sum s_j can be broken into two parts: the contributions from j and from higher floors. For example, s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

But since s_{j+1} >=c, then x_j can be zero. But during the additions of j, the sum x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev must be <c.

But s_{j+1}_prev is the sum of x_{j+1} up to that step.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, where for each j, we track the number of ways to have x_j additions given s_{j+1}.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the sum s_j =x_j + s_{j+1} >=c, and s_{j} must be >=c.

But during the additions of j, each addition requires x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev <c.

But s_{j+1}_prev can vary as we add j's.

But how can we model this? For example, suppose s_{j+1} is s_{j+1}_final >=c.

When adding j's, we need to choose x_j such that during each addition, x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev <c.

But s_{j+1}_prev can be any value up to s_{j+1}_final.

This is challenging.

Maybe we can model the problem for each j in reverse order, considering how many times j can be added given s_{j+1}_final.

Let me think for j=3 (n=3). s_3 =x_3 >=c. But each addition of j=3 must have x_3_prev <c. So x_3 can be exactly c.

For j=2, s_2 =x_2 +x_3 =x_2 +c. s_2 >=c. So x_2 can be 0 or more.

But each addition of j=2 must have x_2_prev +x_3_prev <c.

But x_3_prev is the sum of x_3 up to that step. Since x_3 is c, x_3_prev can be from 0 to c.

So when adding j=2, the sum x_2_prev +x_3_prev <c.

The maximum x_2_prev can be is when x_3_prev is 0: x_2_prev <c.

But x_3_prev can be up to c-1 during the addition of j=2.

For example, adding j=2 once when x_3_prev is 0. Then x_2_prev is 0, sum is 0 <c. Allowed.

Then, adding j=2 again when x_3_prev is 0: sum is 1 <c. Allowed up to x_2_prev =c-1.

But after that, adding j=3, which increases x_3_prev. So during these additions of j=2, x_3_prev is 0.

So the maximum x_2_prev can be c-1.

But once j=3 starts being added, x_3_prev increases, and j=2 can't be added anymore.

So the maximum x_2_prev is c-1, but only if j=2 is added before any j=3's.

In this case, x_2 can be up to c-1, and x_3 =c.

So s_2 =x_2 +c >=c. So x_2 can be 0, 1, ..., c-1.

But this seems to depend on the order of additions.

This suggests that x_j can be at most c-1, but this is only possible if j is added before any higher floors.

But how to model this in the general case.

An alternative approach: the number of ways to arrange the sequence is the product of the number of ways to choose the x_j's for each j, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange them in the sequence under the constraints.

But the problem is to compute this when some positions in the sequence are fixed.

Hmm. Given the complexity of the problem, perhaps the solution involves dynamic programming with state tracking the current counts for each floor. But for n=100, this is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the demo input:

In the first demo input, all entries are zeros, and the output is 6. The valid sequences are those where the sum s_j for each j is >=c=2, and during the sequence, each addition of j must have the sum up to that point for j's floor be <=c.

The valid sequences are those where the first two steps are filled by floors 1 and/or 2, and the last two steps are filled by floor 3. Or something like that.

But how to model this.

Another observation: for each j, the x_j must be the number of times j is added before any j' >j are added, such that x_j + s_{j+1}_prev <c.

But this is not quite right.

Alternatively, the sequence must be such that for each j, all additions of j must occur before any additions of j' >j. Because adding j' >j after j's additions would increase j's sum beyond c, but during the addition of j, the sum must have been <=c.

But this is not necessarily the case. For example, j=1 can be added after j=2's additions, but that depends on the sum up to that point.

This is getting too stuck. Perhaps it's better to look for a way to model the problem with dynamic programming, tracking for each step and for each j, the current sum of j's and higher floors.

But with n up to 100 and m up to 1e4, the state would be too large. However, perhaps we can find that for each j, the sum up to that step for j's and higher floors is s_j, and we can track this in a way that allows for transitions.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of the possible states.

At each step, the state can be represented by the current sum for each j. But this is n variables, which is not feasible for n=100.

Alternative idea: the sum for j is the sum of j's and higher floors. So the sum for j is s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

So, for j=1, s_1 =x_1 + s_2.

s_2 =x_2 +s_3.

...

s_n =x_n.

But for each j, s_j >=c.

But during the sequence, for each addition of j, s_j_prev (before adding) must be <c. So s_j_prev +1 <=c.

But this is only for the additions of j. For other additions (k >j), the sum s_j_prev is increased by 1, but no constraints are checked for j.

So the sum s_j can be up to c + (sum of x_k for k >j).

But sum of x_k for k >j is s_{j+1}.

So s_j =x_j + s_{j+1} >=c.

But during the addition of j, x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev <c.

But s_{j+1}_prev is the sum of x_{j+1} and higher up to that step.

This seems like a dependency that can be modeled with dynamic programming for each j in reverse order.

Let's think of it this way: process the floors from highest to lowest. For each floor j, compute the possible ways to add x_j times, given that the sum of s_{j+1} (from higher floors) is known.

For j =n:

s_n =x_n.

Constraints:

x_n >=c (since s_n >=c).

But each addition of j=n requires that x_n_prev <c. So x_n can be exactly c. Because after adding c times, x_n_prev =c-1, then adding once more makes it c, which is allowed (sum is c). So x_n =c.

For j =n-1:

s_{n-1} =x_{n-1} + s_n =x_{n-1} +c >=c. So x_{n-1} can be 0 or more.

But during each addition of j=n-1, the sum x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev <c.

s_n_prev is the sum of x_n up to that step. Since x_n =c, s_n_prev can be from 0 to c.

So when adding j=n-1, the sum x_{n-1}_prev + s_n_prev must be <c.

But s_n_prev can be up to c. So if s_n_prev is k, then x_{n-1}_prev <c -k.

The maximum x_{n-1}_prev can be is c-1 -k.

But when adding j=n-1, the sequence can interleave between j=n-1 and j=n.

For example:

j=n-1 added once when s_n_prev=0: x_{n-1}_prev=0, 0+0 <c → allowed.

j=n-1 added once when s_n_prev=1: x_{n-1}_prev=0, 0+1 <c → if c>1.

But in this case, the total x_{n-1} can be up to c-1 (assuming s_n_prev varies from 0 to c-1).

But this seems complicated.

Alternative idea: the maximum x_j for each j is c. Because during additions of j, the sum x_j_prev + s_{j+1}_prev must be <c. So x_j can be at most c-1. But this is only true if s_{j+1}_prev is 0.

But if s_{j+1}_prev is large, x_j can't be added at all.

This suggests that the possible x_j's are dependent on the order of additions.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model this problem as follows:

The valid sequence must be such that for each j, the x_j's are added in a way that before each addition, the sum of j and higher floors up to that step is less than c.

Moreover, the total sum for each j and higher floors is at least c.

But how to model this with the given sequence containing fixed elements.

Another approach is to generate the possible x_j's that satisfy sum_{j} x_j =m and for each j, sum_{k >=j} x_k >=c.

Then, for each possible x_j configuration, compute the number of valid permutations (sequences) that can be formed under the constraints that when a j is added, the sum up to that point for j's and higher floors is <c.

But even this seems difficult.

But given that the sum for j's and higher floors in the entire sequence is s_j = sum_{k >=j} x_k >=c.

But during the sequence, each addition of j must have the sum of k >=j up to that step (after addition) <=c.

But this implies that s_j can be >=c only if there are additions of k >j after j's additions. For example, j's sum is x_j + s_{j+1}.

x_j is the number of times j is added. For each addition of j, sum up to that step (after addition) is <=c.

But s_{j+1} can be >=c, but j's x_j can be added such that x_j + s_{j+1}_prev <c for each addition.

For example, j=1, s_2=3, c=2.

Then, x_1 must be added such that x_1_prev + s_2_prev <2.

s_2_prev can be up to 3, but during additions of j=1, s_2_prev is the sum of s_2 up to that point.

But this seems impossible.

So in this case, x_1 can't be added at all, because s_2_prev is 3, which is >=c=2. So x_1_prev +3 >=2, which violates the condition.

But the sum for j=1 must be x_1 +3 >=2. So x_1 can be 0, since 0+3 >=2.

But during the sequence, adding j=1 is not allowed.

So x_1 can be zero.

So the sum s_1 =3 >=2.

So in this case, x_1=0 is allowed.

Thus, the sum s_j can be >=c even if x_j=0.

But how to model this.

This suggests that the sum s_j is sum_{k >=j} x_k >=c.

But for each addition of j, the sum up to that step (k >=j) must be <=c.

Thus, for j, x_j can be added only if s_{j+1}_prev +x_j_prev <c.

But s_{j+1}_prev can be large.

Thus, for j to have x_j>0, s_{j+1}_prev must be <c -x_j_prev.

But s_{j+1}_prev can vary during the sequence.

This seems to require that the additions of j are placed in the sequence before any additions of k >=j+1 that would make s_{j+1}_prev >=c -x_j_prev.

But this is not straightforward.

Given the time I've spent on this and the difficulty, I think the correct approach involves dynamic programming where we track for each floor j, the current sum of s_j up to that step, but optimized for the constraints.

Alternatively, the problem can be modeled using inclusion-exclusion and combinatorial mathematics, but I'm not sure.

Perhaps the solution involves considering the given sequence with fixed entries and filling in the zeros such that for each step, the chosen resident r satisfies the sum up to that point for r's floor.

But with n up to 100 and m up to 1e4, it's challenging.

Another idea: For each position in the sequence, whether it's fixed or zero, the possible choices must satisfy the following:

If the current position is filled with r (could be fixed or choice), then the sum of residents >=r in the sequence up to that position must be <=c.

Moreover, after all positions are filled, the sum for each r must be >=c.

So, for dynamic programming, the state can be represented as, for each r, the current sum of residents >=r up to that point. But with n=100 and sum up to c=100, this is not feasible.

Alternatively, since the sum for each r can be up to c, and higher r's sums are independent, perhaps track for each r the current sum.

But even this would be O(m * (c+1)^n), which is not feasible for n=100.

Alternative idea: The sum for r can be tracked as the minimum between its current value and c. Because once the sum for r reaches c, any further contributions to it (from higher floors) are allowed, but adding r again is not allowed.

But for r, the sum up to any point can exceed c only through contributions from higher floors. But adding r again is only allowed if the sum up to that point (before adding) is <c.

So for the DP state, we can track the sum for each r as the current sum, but clamped to c.

But for each r, the sum can be up to c plus the possible contributions from higher floors. But this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, since the sum for r is s_r = x_r + s_{r+1}, and the sum for r+1 is s_{r+1} >=c, then s_r =x_r + s_{r+1} >=x_r +c.

But during the sequence, x_r can be added only if x_r_prev + s_{r+1}_prev <c. Where s_{r+1}_prev is the sum of r+1's and higher up to that step.

But s_{r+1}_prev can be up to c.

So x_r_prev can be up to c-1.

But s_r =x_r + s_{r+1} >=c.

So x_r >=c - s_{r+1}.

But s_{r+1} >=c.

So x_r >=c -s_{r+1} >=c - (x_{r+1} + s_{r+2}) >= ... >=c - (c + c + ... ) which can be negative. So x_r can be zero.

Thus, for each r, x_r can be between max(0, c - s_{r+1}) and c-1.

But s_{r+1} is a variable.

This is not helpful.

Given the time constraints, I think I need to look for a pattern or formula that can be derived for this problem.

Looking at the sample input:

First sample:

n=3, c=2, m=4.

All zeros. Output 6.

Possible sequences are those where the sum for each j >=c.

For j=3, sum x_3=2. So x_3=2.

For j=2, sum x_2 +x_3 >=2 → x_2 +2 >=2 → x_2 >=0. So x_2 can be 0 or 1.

For j=1, sum x_1 +x_2 +x_3 >=2 → x_1 +x_2 +2 >=2 → x_1 +x_2 >=0. So possible.

But in the valid sequences, the sum for j=3 must be exactly 2. Then, the sum for j=2 must be >=2, which is x_2 +2 >=2. So x_2 >=0.

But when adding j=2, the sum up to that point for j=2 and higher must be <2. So x_2_prev +x_3_prev <2.

But x_3 is 2. So during the sequence, x_3_prev can be 0 or 1 (before adding j=3).

So x_2 can be added when x_3_prev is 0.

For example, x_2=1: added once before any j=3's. Then, j=3's are added twice. Then, j=1's added once.

But the sum for j=1's is 1+1+2=4.

But in the sequence, the first two elements can be j=1 and j=2, then j=3's.

But the exact allowed sequences depend on the order.

The sample's valid sequences are:

1. [1, 1, 3, 3]

x_1=2, x_3=2.

Sum for j=3: 2 >=2.

Sum for j=2:0+2=2 >=2.

Sum for j=1:2+0+2=4 >=2.

Each addition of j=1 and j=3 must be allowed.

The sum for j=1 after the first two steps is 2 (two 1's), which is <=2. Allowed.

The sum for j=3 after each addition is 1, then 2. Allowed.

Thus, the x_j's are determined, but their order is also important.

Thus, the problem requires counting the number of valid sequences with certain x_j's and their order.

But how to compute this for general cases.

An alternative approach is to generate all possible x_j's that satisfy sum x_j =m and s_j =sum_{k>=j} x_k >=c for all j. Then, for each valid x_j configuration, compute the number of valid sequences (permutations) that respect the constraints.

But how.

For a given x_j configuration, the valid sequences are those where, for each occurrence of j in the sequence, the sum of k >=j up to that point is <=c.

This is similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to interleave the x_j's such that each j's additions are before their sum reaches c.

But how to compute this.

For a given x_j configuration, the number of valid sequences can be computed as the product of the number of valid ways to interleave the j's additions with the higher floors' additions, such that for each j, the sum of j's additions up to any point is <=c - s_{j+1}_prev.

This is getting too complicated.

Given the time and complexity, I think the solution involves dynamic programming with a state that tracks the current sum for each j, but optimized for the problem constraints.

But given that I'm stuck, I'll look for hints in the sample input.

Sample input 1's output is 6, and the valid sequences are:

The possible x_j's are:

For example, x_3=2, x_1=2, x_2=0.

Or x_3=2, x_1=1, x_2=1.

But how do these configurations fit into the allowed sequences.

Alternatively, for each j from n down to 1:

- x_j can be chosen such that x_j <=c and x_j + s_{j+1} >=c.

But this is not directly helpful.

Another observation: For a given j, the earliest x_j can be added is when the sum of higher floors is zero, allowing x_j to be up to c-1. But once higher floors are added, x_j can't be added anymore.

Thus, the x_j's must be added before any higher floors are added.

This suggests that the sequence must be filled in the order of higher floors first.

Wait, no. Because higher floors can be added after lower floors. For example, in the sample input, j=3 is added after j=1 and j=2.

But the sum for j=3 is exactly c=2, and they are added after other floors.

Thus, the order can vary.

But the key is that when adding a lower floor j, higher floors' sums may not have been filled yet.

This problem is quite challenging. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll outline the approach.

The solution likely involves dynamic programming with the following state:

- Current position in the sequence.

- For each j, the number of times j has been added so far.

- For each j, the sum of k >=j added so far (which is x_j_so_far + sum_{k>j} x_k_so_far).

But this state is too large for n=100.

An alternative is to track for each j, the current sum of k >=j. But this is O(n) per state, which is still not feasible.

But given that c is up to 100, perhaps the sums can be compressed.

For example, for each j, the sum of k >=j can be up to c plus the sum of higher floors' x_k, but higher floors' sums are exactly c.

But this is unclear.

Another idea: since higher floors' sums are exactly c, for j, the sum is x_j + s_{j+1} =x_j +c (if s_{j+1} is exactly c). So for j, the sum is x_j +c >=c. So x_j can be 0 or more.

But during the sequence, adding j requires x_j_prev +c_prev <c, where c_prev is the sum of higher floors up to that step.

But this seems not helpful.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to realize that for each j, the sum of j's and higher floors' additions is exactly c. So s_j =c for all j. This is possible because:

If s_j =c for all j, then sum_{k >=j} x_k =c.

But then, sum x_j = sum_{j=1}^n x_j = sum_{j=1}^n (c - s_{j+1}).

But s_{j+1} =c for j+1.

So x_j =c -c =0 for j <n. x_n =c.

But this would require that sum x_j =c, which may not match m.

Thus, this is not possible unless m =c.

But the sample input has m=4 and c=2. So this approach is incorrect.

Thus, my earlier conclusion that s_j can be larger than c is correct.

But how to model this.

I think I'm stuck and need to refer to the problem's hints or consider that the correct approach is to model the problem using dynamic programming with a state that tracks the current sum for each j.

But given the time constraints, I'll proceed to code a solution based on the following approach:

For each test case:

1. Check if the given sequence has fixed elements that are invalid (e.g., a fixed j is added after their sum has reached c).

2. For the zeros in the sequence, generate possible candidates for each position, considering the current sum of j >=r for each r.

But the code would have to track the sum for each j up to each position.

But with n=100 and m=1e4, this is not feasible.

Alternatively, since the sum for j is the sum of j and higher floors, perhaps the sum can be represented in a way that allows for efficient computation.

But I'm not sure. Given that this is a programming problem, the solution likely involves dynamic programming with a state that tracks the current sum for each j up to the current step. However, given the constraints, this might be possible with optimizations.

But for n=100 and m=1e4, even this is not feasible.

Alternative idea inspired by the sample input:

The sum for j must be at least c. For j=1, this sum is m. So m >=c.

But the sample input has m=4 and c=2, which satisfies m >=c.

But this is not helpful.

Another observation: Each time a resident j is added, the sum for j's and higher floors increases by 1. So the sum for j's and higher floors can be tracked as a single variable.

But for each j, the sum for j's and higher floors is s_j. When adding j, the sum s_j increases by 1.

But when adding k >j, the sum s_j also increases by 1.

But the constraints for adding j is that s_j_prev <c. So when adding j, s_j_prev must be <c.

But for other additions (k >j), the sum s_j_prev can be >=c.

Thus, the sum s_j can be up to any value, but during additions of j, s_j_prev must be <c.

Thus, the problem can be viewed as:

For each j, the number of times j is added is x_j.

These x_j's must satisfy sum x_j =m.

For each j, the sum x_j + sum_{k >j} x_k >=c.

Additionally, during the sequence, whenever j is added, the sum x_j_prev + sum_{k >j} x_k_prev <c.

But how to model this.

The key insight is that the sum for j and higher floors is s_j = x_j + s_{j+1}.

For each j, the sum s_j must be >=c.

Additionally, during the sequence, for each addition of j, the sum s_j_prev <c.

Thus, the sum s_j can be written as s_j =c + a_j, where a_j >=0.

But how to model the sequence of additions.

Another approach inspired by the solution to the first sample:

The sum s_j for each j is exactly c. Thus, x_j =c - sum_{k>j} x_k.

But sum_{k>j} x_k = s_{j+1}.

So x_j =c - s_{j+1}.

But s_j =x_j + s_{j+1} =c.

This would imply that s_j =c for all j. But then sum_{j=1}^n s_j =n*c.

But sum_{j=1}^n s_j = sum_{j=1}^n sum_{k>=j} x_k = sum_{k=1}^n x_k *k. Because each x_k is counted in s_j for all j <=k.

But sum_{j=1}^n s_j = sum_{k=1}^n x_k *k.

If s_j =c for all j, then sum_{k=1}^n x_k *k =n*c.

But the sample input has m=4, which is sum x_k=4. For n=3 and c=2, 3*2=6, but sum x_k *k =1*1 +0*2 +2*3=1+0+6=7, which is not 6.

Thus, this approach is incorrect.

Thus, the sum s_j can be larger than c.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to give up and look for a different approach. Perhaps the problem requires precomputing all possible valid x_j configurations, then for each, compute the number of valid permutations.

But even this seems difficult.

Final thought: This problem is extremely complex, and I'm not able to find a solution within the time. The correct approach likely involves dynamic programming with state tracking for each j's current sum, but optimized in some way. However, given the time and the problem's difficulty, I'm unable to proceed further.
