Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to compute the sum of elements in a given range [l, r] of an infinite binary sequence. The sequence is defined such that for m > n, a_m is the XOR of the prefix up to floor(m/2). The challenge is handling very large l and r (up to 1e18) efficiently without exceeding memory or time limits.

First, let me understand the problem again. The initial n elements are given. For each m beyond n, a_m is the XOR of a_1 to a_{floor(m/2)}. Wait, no, the problem says a_m is the XOR of a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_{floor(m/2)}. So each new term is the cumulative XOR up to half its index. For example, m=5: floor(5/2)=2, so a_5 is a_1 XOR a_2. Then a_6 would be a_1 XOR a_2 XOR a_3 (since floor(6/2)=3), and so on.

Wait, but then for m > n, each a_m is the cumulative XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements. Wait, that's different from the recurrence. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem says: For m > n, a_m = a_1 ⊕ a_2 ⊕ ... ⊕ a_{floor(m/2)}. So a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements, not the cumulative up to m-1 or anything. Oh right, so each a_m is the prefix XOR up to floor(m/2). So for example, for m=5, a_5 is prefix_xor[2], since floor(5/2) is 2. Then m=6, floor(6/2)=3, so a_6 is prefix_xor[3]. But prefix_xor[3] is a_1 ^ a_2 ^ a_3. So for m=6, a_6 is the XOR of the first 3 elements.

Wait, but prefix_xor[k] is the XOR of the first k elements. So a_m is equal to prefix_xor[ floor(m/2) ].

But wait, when m is beyond n, how do we compute this? Because for m > n, the prefix_xor of floor(m/2) may also be beyond the original n elements. Wait no. For example, if m is 2n, then floor(m/2) is n, which is within the original array. But for m=2n+1, floor(m/2) is n, which is within. Then for m=2n+2, floor(m/2) is n+1, which is beyond the original array.

So the problem is that the a_m's for m >n depend on the prefix_xor of floor(m/2), which may itself be beyond the original n elements, leading to a recursive computation.

So to compute a_m for m>n, we need to compute prefix_xor up to floor(m/2). But the prefix_xor for those indices depends on earlier computations. So this is a recursive problem.

But how can we model this? Let's think of the prefix_xor as a function f(k), which returns the XOR of the first k elements of the sequence. Then for any k <=n, f(k) is the known prefix_xor. For k >n, f(k) = f(k-1) XOR a_k. But a_k for k>n is equal to f( floor(k/2) ), since a_k = XOR of the first floor(k/2) elements. Wait no, a_k is the XOR of the first floor(k/2) elements. So a_k = f( floor(k/2) ), but that's for k>n. Then f(k) = f(k-1) XOR a_k = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) ). 

So the function f(k) is defined recursively as follows:

if k <=n: f(k) = prefix_xor[k] (precomputed)
else: f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) )

Yes. So to compute f(k) for k >n, we need to compute f(k-1) and f( floor(k/2) ). This recursive approach can be memoized, but for very large k (up to 1e18), memoization would be impossible with standard memo tables, as the number of unique k's could be huge, leading to memory issues.

So the previous approaches using memoization (like lru_cache or a dictionary) would hit memory limits when dealing with very large k values. For example, if a query has to compute f(1e18), the number of entries in the memo dictionary could be up to O(log k) steps, but perhaps the number is manageable if the recursion is structured properly. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Each time we compute f(k), we need f(k-1) and f(k//2). So for k, it depends on k-1 and k//2. Let's see for a large k, like k=1e18.

f(1e18) = f(1e18 -1) XOR f(5e17)

Then f(1e18-1) depends on f(1e18-2) and f( (1e18-1)//2 )

This seems like a lot of unique k's. So a memoization approach with a dictionary could store O(log k) entries for each unique k encountered, but for queries with a large range [l, r], this could still be expensive. For example, if the range is large, the sum over that range would require many f(k) evaluations, leading to a lot of memo entries. Hence, the memory limit could be exceeded.

So the problem with the previous code is that it uses a memo dictionary which grows with the number of unique k's needed. For the hard version of the problem, with l and r up to 1e18, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Find a way to compute the sum of a_l to a_r without explicitly computing each a_i, but rather by finding patterns or mathematical properties that allow for bulk computation.

Let me think about the structure of the sequence. Since each a_m for m>n is equal to the prefix_xor of floor(m/2), which is f( floor(m/2) ). But f(k) is the prefix_xor up to k. So a_m = f( floor(m/2) ). So for even m, floor(m/2) is m/2. For odd m, it's (m-1)/2.

But then, the sum from l to r can be split into the sum of a_m for m in [l, r], where a_m is either part of the original array (if m <=n) or f( floor(m/2) ) (if m >n).

So the sum S = sum_{m=l}^r a_m.

We can split this sum into two parts:

1. m <=n: sum the original a[m] if they are within [l, r].

2. m >n: sum f( floor(m/2) ), but since m >n, floor(m/2) can be >=n or <n. Wait, if m >n, then floor(m/2) can be up to (1e18)/2, which is 5e17. So even for m>n, floor(m/2) could be greater than n, leading to recursive computation of f.

But how can we model this?

The key observation is that for m >n, a_m is f( floor(m/2) ), and f(k) for k>n is built recursively. So, the sum over a_m for m >n can be transformed into a sum over f(k) for certain k's, but those k's may also require summing f(k') for other k's, leading to a recursive structure.

Another approach: Let's note that a_m for m>n can be expressed in terms of f(k) where k is floor(m/2). So, for m even: m = 2k, then a_m = f(k). For m odd: m = 2k +1, then a_m = f(k). So for each m >n, a_m is f(k) where k is floor(m/2).

So the sum of a_m from A to B (where A and B are >n) can be split into even and odd m's. For each even m in [A, B], it's f(k) where k = m/2. For each odd m in [A, B], it's f(k) where k = (m-1)/2.

Thus, the sum of a_m for m in [A, B] is equal to the sum of f(k) for k in [A_even_start, A_even_end] (each even m contributes k = m/2) plus the sum of f(k) for k in [A_odd_start, A_odd_end] (each odd m contributes k = (m-1)/2).

So, the problem reduces to computing sums of f(k) over certain ranges. But f(k) is the prefix_xor up to k, which is a recursive function. So how do we compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b]?

The sum of f(k) from a to b is required. But f(k) is defined recursively. So the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.

Let me think about f(k) again. For k <=n, f(k) is known. For k>n, f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) ).

But XOR is not additive, which complicates the sum. Because the sum of XORs is not the same as XOR of sums. So, the sum of f(k) over a range is not straightforward.

Wait, but wait, the problem requires the sum of a_m, which is the sum of f( floor(m/2) ) for m>n. So each a_m is either 0 or 1, and the sum is the count of 1's in the range. But f(k) is the cumulative XOR up to k, which is a binary value (0 or 1) since all a_i are binary. Because XOR of a sequence of 0s and 1s is 0 if there are even 1s, 1 otherwise.

Wait, this is a crucial insight! Because each a_i is 0 or 1, the cumulative XOR f(k) is 0 or 1. Because XOR is a parity operation. So for example, f(k) is 1 if there are an odd number of 1s in the first k elements, 0 otherwise.

This changes everything. Because f(k) can only be 0 or 1. So when we compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b], we are just counting how many times the cumulative XOR is 1 in that range.

But how can we model this? Let's think of the function f(k) as a binary function (0 or 1). Then, the sum of f(k) from a to b is the number of times f(k) is 1 in that interval.

So, the problem now becomes: for a range of k values, count how many times f(k) is 1. And f(k) is determined by the recurrence:

f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) )

But since f(k) is 0 or 1, XOR is equivalent to addition modulo 2. So:

f(k) = (f(k-1) + f( floor(k/2) )) % 2

But even with this, it's not clear how to model the sum. The challenge is to find a way to compute the number of 1s in f(k) over a range [a, b] without computing each f(k) individually, especially for very large a and b.

Let me try to find a pattern or recurrence for f(k). Let's compute f(k) for small k beyond n, given some initial values.

Suppose n=1, a_1=1.

Then for k>1:

f(1) = 1 (prefix_xor[1] = a1 =1)

f(2) = f(1) XOR f(1) = 1 XOR 1 = 0

f(3) = f(2) XOR f(1) = 0 XOR 1 =1

f(4) = f(3) XOR f(2) =1 XOR 0=1

f(5) = f(4) XOR f(2) =1 XOR 0=1

f(6) = f(5) XOR f(3) =1 XOR 1=0

Hmm. Not seeing an obvious pattern here. But since the f(k) is built using previous values, perhaps there's a way to memoize or represent the function with a state that can be compressed.

Another idea: Since f(k) depends on f(k-1) and f( floor(k/2) ), perhaps the function has a tree-like dependency. For example, to compute f(k), you need to compute two other values. But for large k, this leads to a lot of dependencies, which would be computationally expensive.

Alternative approach: Since each a_m is the XOR of the first floor(m/2) elements (i.e., f(floor(m/2))), and a_m is either 0 or 1, perhaps the sum can be represented as a function of floor(m/2). So for even and odd m's, group them into their respective k's.

But how?

Wait, for m >n:

If m is even: a_m = f(m/2)

If m is odd: a_m = f( (m-1)/2 )

So, for a range [A, B], m >n:

sum_a = sum_{m=A}^B a_m = sum_{m even in [A,B]} f(m/2) + sum_{m odd in [A,B]} f( (m-1)/2 )

So, let's separate the sum into even and odd m:

Let’s compute for even m:

even_start = first even m >=A

even_end = last even m <=B

number of even terms is (even_end - even_start)/2 +1

For each even term m, the corresponding k is m/2. So the sum for even terms is sum_{k = even_start//2 to even_end//2} f(k)

Similarly for odd terms:

odd_start = first odd m >=A

odd_end = last odd m <=B

number of odd terms is (odd_end - odd_start)/2 +1

Each odd term m contributes f( (m-1)/2 ), which is the same as f( k ), where k = (m-1)/2. So the sum for odd terms is sum_{k = (odd_start-1)/2 to (odd_end-1)/2} f(k)

Thus, the problem reduces to computing two sums: sum of f(k) over the even k's and sum over the odd k's. But then, these k's can be in ranges that are still very large (up to 1e18 /2). So even with this transformation, we need an efficient way to compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b], where a and b can be up to 5e17.

But since f(k) is binary, the sum is the count of 1s in f(k) over [a, b]. So, if we can find a way to compute the number of 1s in f(k) for a range [a, b], then that gives the sum.

But how to compute this count efficiently?

The key is to model f(k) and find a pattern or recurrence that allows us to compute the number of 1s in a range without iterating through each element.

Let's think about f(k) again. The recurrence is:

f(k) = (f(k-1) + f( floor(k/2) )) % 2

This is a bit like a linear recurrence, but with a dependency on floor(k/2).

Another idea: for each k, the value of f(k) depends on f(k-1) and f(k//2). Maybe this can be represented as a memoization with memoization that can be pruned or stored efficiently.

But given the constraints of 1e18, even memoization with a dictionary may not be feasible.

Alternative approach: dynamic programming with memoization for specific ranges.

Wait, perhaps the function f(k) has a periodicity or can be represented in terms of binary representations of k. For example, maybe the function f(k) depends on the binary digits of k, and we can model it using binary trie-like approach.

Alternatively, let's try to compute f(k) for a few values beyond n and see if a pattern emerges.

Let's take the sample input 2:

n=2, a=[1,0]

prefix_xor for n=2 is [0,1, 1^0=1]

For k>2:

f(3) = f(2) XOR f(1) = 1 XOR 1 = 0

f(4) = f(3) XOR f(2) =0 XOR1 =1

f(5) = f(4) XOR f(2) =1 XOR1=0

f(6)=f(5) XOR f(3) =0 XOR0=0

f(7)=f(6) XOR f(3) =0 XOR0=0

f(8)=f(7) XOR f(4) =0 XOR1=1

Hmm. The sequence of f(k) for k>2 is 0,1,0,0,0,1... Not obvious.

Another example: n=1, a=[1]. Then:

k=1: f(1) =1.

k=2: f(2) =f(1) XOR f(1) =0.

k=3: f(3) =f(2) XOR f(1) =0 XOR1=1.

k=4: f(4) =f(3) XOR f(2) =1 XOR0=1.

k=5: f(5) =f(4) XOR f(2) =1 XOR0=1.

k=6: f(6) =f(5) XOR f(3) =1 XOR1=0.

k=7: f(7) =f(6) XOR f(3) =0 XOR1=1.

k=8: f(8) =f(7) XOR f(4) =1 XOR1=0.

Hmm. The sequence for f(k) here is 0,1,1,1,0,1,0... Not obvious.

It seems that the function f(k) is not easily predictable, and thus, we need a way to compute f(k) and sum over ranges efficiently.

Alternative idea: memoize f(k), but use a cache that can handle large k. However, for very large ranges, even with memoization, the number of calls may be too high.

Another approach: Since the sum is required for ranges [a, b] of f(k), and each f(k) is either 0 or 1, perhaps we can model this sum using a binary decision tree, where each level represents a bit in the binary representation of k. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think recursively. For a given range [a, b], can we split it into parts and compute the sum recursively?

For example, sum(a, b) = sum(a, mid) + sum(mid+1, b), where mid is (a+b)/2. But for large ranges, this would require O(log(b-a+1)) steps, but each step would need to compute the sum of f(k) for the subrange.

But how to compute sum(a, b) efficiently.

Alternatively, note that the recurrence for f(k) involves f(k//2). So, when we need to compute f(k), we can model it as a function that depends on a path of divisions by 2. For example, k is divided by 2 each time until it reaches a base case (k <=n). So, the number of steps to compute f(k) is O(log k). But for summing over a large range, this is still expensive.

Another observation: Since f(k) depends on f(k-1) and f(k//2), the sequence of f(k) can be thought of as a binary tree where each node depends on its left neighbor and its parent. But this structure may not have a pattern that can be exploited for summation.

Given that the previous attempts using memoization are hitting memory limits, perhaps we need to find a way to compute the sum of f(k) over a range without explicitly storing all the f(k) values.

Let me think about the sum S(a, b) = sum_{k=a}^b f(k). Since f(k) is 0 or 1, this is the count of 1s in [a, b].

We can model this as a recursive function. For example, S(a, b) can be split into S(a, m) + S(m+1, b), where m is (a + b) // 2. For each m, compute the sum for the left and right halves. But for this, we need a way to compute f(k) for each k in the range.

But how to compute this efficiently. If each call to S(a, b) splits into two subproblems, and for each subproblem, we need to compute the sum of f(k) for that range, this could be done in O(log(b-a+1)) steps, but each step requires evaluating f for the midpoint, which takes O(log k) time. But for a range of 1e18, this would be O((log k)^2) per query. Given that t can be 1e4, this may be manageable.

Wait, but for each f(k) evaluation, the time is O(log k), since each recursive step reduces k by dividing by 2 and subtracting 1. For example, f(k) calls f(k-1) and f(k//2), each of which may call other values. But with memoization, each unique k is computed once. So for the sum S(a, b), the number of unique k's that need to be computed is O(b - a + 1), which is again not feasible for large ranges.

Thus, this approach would work for small ranges but not for large ones. So we need a smarter way.

Alternative idea: Notice that for k >n, the function f(k) can be expressed as a parity (even or odd) of some function's values. Perhaps there's a way to model f(k) in terms of the binary representation of k.

But I'm not seeing it.

Another approach: Since each f(k) is computed as f(k-1) XOR f(k//2), and XOR is addition modulo 2, we can represent this as:

f(k) = (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) mod 2.

This is a linear recurrence modulo 2. Perhaps this allows us to model the sequence as a linear function, and then use matrix exponentiation or some other linear algebra technique. But the recurrence is not linear in the usual sense because it depends on k//2, which is a non-linear operation.

Alternatively, think of the recurrence in terms of binary digits. For example, when you write k in binary, perhaps you can find a way to compute f(k) based on the bits of k.

Let's try to compute f(k) for some k in binary and see if a pattern emerges.

Take n=1, a_1=1. So f(1)=1.

k=2: 10 in binary. f(2)=0.

k=3:11. f(3)=1.

k=4:100. f(4)=1.

k=5:101. f(5)=1.

k=6:110. f(6)=0.

k=7:111. f(7)=1.

k=8:1000. f(8)=0.

k=9:1001. f(9)=1.

k=10:1010. f(10)=0.

Not seeing a clear pattern here.

Another example: n=2, a=[1,0]. Then f(1)=1, f(2)=1.

k=3: f(3)=0.

k=4: f(4)=1.

k=5:0.

k=6:0.

k=7:0.

k=8:1.

k=9:1.

k=10:0.

Hmm. Still no obvious pattern.

Alternative idea: For k >n, f(k) depends on f(k-1) and f(k//2). Let's model this as a function that can be represented with a memoization cache, but optimize the cache by limiting its size. But how?

Wait, since the sum is required over ranges [a, b], and each time we split the problem into even and odd ranges, perhaps the same k's are being queried multiple times, and memoization can help. But with large ranges, the cache size may still be prohibitive.

Alternatively, can we find that for certain ranges, the sum can be computed based on the sum of their halves? For example, sum(a, b) = sum(a//2, b//2) + sum( (a-1)//2, (b-1)//2 ), or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the recurrence again. For k>n:

f(k) = (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) % 2

So the sum from a to b is sum_{k=a}^b (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) mod 2.

But summing over mod 2 is not additive, so this approach may not help.

Another angle: The sum of f(k) from a to b is equal to the sum_{k=a}^b (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) mod 2. Which is equal to sum_{k=a}^b (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) - 2 * sum_{k=a}^b ( (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) // 2 )

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternative idea: precompute for all possible k up to a certain depth, but since k can be up to 1e18, this is impossible.

Hmm. It's clear that the initial approach with memoization is not feasible due to memory constraints. So what can be done differently?

Let's look at the previous code:

The code used a dictionary for memoization of f(k). For each test case, the memo is built, and sum_f is computed recursively. But for very large ranges, this memo can grow very large.

The problem statement allows sum of n up to 2e5 per test case. But when handling large ranges, the number of unique k's in the memo could be O(log k) per query. But for multiple queries, this could add up.

Wait, but each test case is processed independently. So, for each test case, the memo is built, used for the current query, and then discarded. So if the memo for one test case has O(1e5) entries, but there are 1e4 test cases, the total memory used is O(1e9), which is way too much.

Thus, the previous approach is not feasible for multiple test cases with large ranges.

So, what's the alternative? We need a way to compute f(k) without memoizing all the computed values.

Alternative idea: Compute f(k) on the fly, but with memoization per test case. But for large ranges, this is still problematic.

Another idea: Since f(k) is computed recursively, and each step depends on k-1 and k//2, perhaps the function can be represented using a cache that only keeps the necessary values. However, even this may not be sufficient.

Wait, but for a given k, to compute f(k), we need to compute f(k-1) and f(k//2). If k is large, say 1e18, then k//2 is 5e17. To compute f(5e17), we need to compute f(5e17-1) and f(2.5e17), and so on. Each of these steps reduces k by dividing by 2 and subtracting 1. The number of unique k's visited for a single f(k) computation is O(log k). For example, for k=1e18, the recursion depth is O(log k) = 60. So for each f(k) call, the number of new entries added to the memo is O(log k). 

But if the sum range is large, say [a, b] with a=1e18 and b=1e18, then for sum_f(a, b), which is just f(1e18), the memo will store O(60) entries. But if the range is large, like a=1 and b=1e18, this would require O(1e18) entries, which is impossible.

But wait, in the code, the sum is computed by splitting the range into two halves recursively. For example, sum_f(a, b) is sum_f(a, mid) + sum_f(mid+1, b). Each recursive call splits the range into two until the range is a single element. For a range of size S, this requires O(S) recursive calls, which is not feasible for large S. For example, if the range is 1e18 elements, this is impossible.

Thus, the previous approach of recursively splitting the range into two parts is not feasible for large ranges. Hence, the code exceeds the memory limit due to the excessive number of recursive calls and memo entries.

So, to solve this, we need to find a way to compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b] without explicitly iterating through each k and without using excessive memory.

Alternative idea: Find a pattern in the parity of f(k) over ranges, using the fact that the recurrence is additive modulo 2. For example, maybe there's a way to represent the sum using some mathematical formula.

Let's think about the parity of the sum. The sum is the number of 1s in the range. Since each f(k) is 0 or 1, the sum is the count of 1s. Let's denote the sum as S(a, b).

We need to find S(a, b) = sum_{k=a}^b f(k).

But how?

Another observation: For k >n, f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) )

But XOR is equivalent to addition modulo 2. So:

f(k) = (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) % 2

This is a linear recurrence in modulo 2. Linear recurrences can sometimes be represented using matrices or other linear algebra techniques, but the recurrence here depends on k//2, which complicates things.

But perhaps we can find a way to model the sum S(a, b) using this recurrence.

For example, S(a, b) = sum_{k=a}^b f(k)

= sum_{k=a}^b (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) % 2

But since we're summing the mod 2 values, this isn't directly helpful.

Alternatively, we can expand the recurrence for each k:

f(k) = (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) % 2

But this recurrence isn't straightforward to unroll for all k in [a, b], especially since it depends on two previous terms.

Another idea: Let's compute the sum S(a, b) in terms of the sum of previous values.

But how?

For example, S(a, b) = sum_{k=a}^b f(k) 

= sum_{k=a}^b [ (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) % 2 ]

= sum_{k=a}^b [ (f(k-1) + f(k//2) ) - 2 * ( (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) // 2 ) ]

= sum_{k=a}^b (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) - 2 * sum_{k=a}^b ( (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) // 2 )

But this doesn't seem helpful, as it's not clear how to compute the second term.

Another approach: Perhaps the sum S(a, b) can be expressed using the sum of f(k) up to b minus the sum up to a-1.

Let’s define prefix_sum(k) = sum_{i=1}^k f(i). Then S(a, b) = prefix_sum(b) - prefix_sum(a-1).

If we can find a way to compute prefix_sum(k), then the problem becomes manageable.

But how to compute prefix_sum(k) for large k?

The key is to find a way to compute prefix_sum(k) recursively.

Let’s split the sum into two parts: sum from 1 to k = sum from 1 to k//2 and sum from k//2 +1 to k.

But this doesn’t directly help.

Alternatively, let's note that for even and odd k:

If k is even: floor(k/2) = k/2.

If k is odd: floor(k/2) = (k-1)/2.

But this may not help directly.

Another idea: For the recurrence f(k) = (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) % 2, perhaps the prefix_sum can be expressed in terms of the prefix_sums of smaller ranges.

But it's unclear.

Alternatively, considering that the sum of f(k) from a to b can be computed as the sum of (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) mod 2, perhaps there's a way to express this sum in terms of the sum of f(k-1) and sum of f(k//2) modulo 2.

But since the mod is applied per term, this doesn't directly sum to the total sum mod 2.

Thus, this approach is not useful.

At this point, I'm stuck. I need to think of a different approach.

Another angle: Since each a_m for m >n is equal to f( floor(m/2) ), and f(k) is the prefix_xor up to k, which is 0 or 1. So, the sum of a_m for m in [A, B] is the sum of f(k) for k in [a, b], where a and b are the corresponding floor(m/2) values for even and odd m's.

Thus, the problem reduces to calculating the sum of f(k) over certain ranges. But how to compute this sum efficiently.

The key insight is that f(k) can be computed recursively, and the number of unique k's required for each query is O(log k), which can be memoized per query. Since each query is processed independently, and the memo is cleared after each query, the memory usage per query is manageable.

So, the plan is:

For each query:

1. Precompute the prefix_xor for the initial array.

2. Compute the sum of the elements in [l, r] that are <=n using the initial array.

3. For elements >n, split into even and odd m's and compute the sum of f(k) for the corresponding k ranges.

4. For each such k range, compute the sum using a recursive function with memoization, but limit the memo to the current query.

5. Use a memoization cache per query (not global) to avoid accumulating entries across test cases.

In Python, using a dictionary for memoization per function call might still be feasible if the number of entries per query is O(log k), which is manageable since log(1e18) is around 60. Thus, for each query, even if the range is large, the number of unique k's memoized would be O(log k), which is acceptable.

But the previous code uses a dictionary memo for f(k), and sum_f splits the range recursively, leading to O(b-a+1) steps. For example, if a=1e18 and b=1e18, sum_f is just f(1e18), which is manageable. But if a=1 and b=1e18, sum_f would require O(1e18) steps, which is impossible.

So the previous approach has a problem in the sum_f function. The way sum_f is computed by splitting the range into halves recursively results in O(b-a+1) recursive calls, which is infeasible for large ranges.

Thus, the key problem is in the sum_f function. To compute the sum of f(k) over a large range, we need a way to compute this sum efficiently.

The solution is to compute the sum recursively, but for ranges [a, b], if a >n, we can split the sum into the sum of even and odd k's, similar to how we split the original problem.

Wait, but for the sum of f(k) from a to b:

For each k in [a, b], f(k) = (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) %2.

But this recurrence makes it difficult to compute the sum directly.

Alternative idea: Precompute the sum of f(k) for certain ranges and use memoization for those sums.

But this would require storing sums for ranges, which could be more efficient than storing individual f(k) values.

For example, we can memoize the sum of f(k) for a range [a, b], and split the range into smaller ranges recursively. For each range, if the sum is already computed, return it. Otherwise, split into left and right, compute their sums, and memoize the result.

But for large ranges, this would require storing a large number of ranges, which is not feasible.

Another Idea: Since f(k) is a function that can be computed recursively in O(log k) time per call, perhaps we can compute the sum of f(k) from a to b by noting that each term contributes a value based on its path through the recurrence. This could allow us to compute the sum in O(polylog(b)) time.

But I'm not sure how to implement this.

At this point, perhaps the only feasible way is to compute the sum of f(k) from a to b by iterating through each k and accumulating the result. But this is impossible for large ranges.

Alternative Idea: Note that f(k) depends on f(k-1) and f(k//2). So the sum can be expressed as:

sum_{k=a}^b f(k) = sum_{k=a}^b (f(k-1) + f(k//2)) mod 2.

But since mod 2 is involved, this isn't directly helpful. However, the sum of mod 2 terms can be expressed in terms of parity.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: We can represent the sum as the number of times the parity is 1. But how to find this count.

At this point, I'm stuck. I need to find a way to compute the sum of f(k) for a range [a, b] efficiently.

Let me think about the memoization approach again. For each query, the memo is built for the current test case. For each k, the number of memo entries is O(log k). For a query that requires sum_f(a, b) where a and b are large, say a=1e18 and b=1e18, then sum_f(a, b) is f(1e18), which requires O(log 1e18) = 60 memo entries. For a query with a range like a=1e18 and b=1e18 + 1e5, the number of memo entries is O(1e5 * log k), which is 1e5 *60=6e6 entries per query. For 1e4 queries, this is 6e10 entries, which is way too much.

Thus, the previous approach is not feasible for large ranges.

Alternative Idea: Use a binary search-like approach to compute the sum. For example, compute the sum from a to b by finding the contribution of each bit in the binary representation of the numbers.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Realize that for k >n, the value of f(k) can be represented as a function of the binary representation of k. For example, each bit in k contributes to the parity. This is a long shot, but perhaps there's a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity depends on the number of set bits in k's binary representation or something similar. But from the examples earlier, this doesn't seem to hold.

At this point, I'm stuck. I need to find a way to compute the sum without memoizing all the f(k) values.

Let me think again about the problem's constraints. The sum of f(k) is required for ranges [a, b], where a and b can be up to 1e18. The only way to handle this is to find a pattern or a way to compute the sum in O(polylog) time.

Another Idea: Observe that f(k) is built using the recurrence f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2). This can be viewed as a binary tree where each node has two children: k-1 and k//2. But traversing this tree is not feasible for large k.

But perhaps there's a way to compute the sum by grouping nodes that share certain properties. For example, nodes with the same k//2 can be grouped together.

Alternatively, note that for even k and k+1:

f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(k//2)

f(k+1) = f(k) XOR f( (k+1)//2 )

But (k+1)//2 is (k//2) +1 if k is odd. Not sure.

Alternatively, for even k:

k = 2m → f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(m)

k-1 = 2m-1 → f(2m-1) = f(2m-2) XOR f(m-1)

For even k, f(k) depends on f(2m-1) and f(m).

This seems to be getting us nowhere.

Alternative Idea: Instead of memoizing f(k), memoize the sum of f(k) over certain intervals. For example, for ranges [a, b], compute the sum once and reuse it for overlapping ranges. But even this is unclear.

Given that the time is limited and the problem is challenging, perhaps the only way to proceed is to find a way to compute the sum_f(a, b) in a way that doesn't require visiting every element in the range.

The key insight is that the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b] can be computed using divide and conquer, but with the number of steps being O(log (b-a+1)), and for each step, the number of new memo entries is O(1).

Let's try to implement the sum_f function using a different approach. Instead of splitting the range into two parts and summing each, perhaps we can find that the sum can be computed based on the sum of smaller ranges.

For example, sum_f(a, b) = sum_f(a, m) + sum_f(m+1, b), where m is the midpoint. But for large ranges, this would require O(log (b-a+1)) steps. But for each sum_f call, we have to compute the sum for the left and right halves. However, each call to sum_f would generate more calls, leading to a binary tree of calls with O(log (b-a+1)) depth. For each of these calls, the sum of the left and right halves is computed, and each time, f(k) is computed with memoization.

But even this approach could lead to O( (b-a+1) / 2^i ) steps at each level i of the binary split. For example, for a range of 1e18, this is 60 levels (since log2(1e18) is ~60), but each level has 2^i steps. So for the first level, 1 step (sum_f(1e18, 1e18)), the second level 2 steps, and so on. But 2^60 is way too large.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Another Idea: Let's consider that f(k) can be represented as a function that can be computed in O(1) time once some other values are known. But this is only possible with memoization.

Given that the previous code uses a dictionary for memoization, and the problem is memory limit, perhaps the solution is to replace the dictionary with a more memory-efficient structure. For example, using a list or a binary trie. But this is unlikely.

Another Idea: Since each test case is processed independently, and the memo is cleared after each test case, perhaps the previous code's memory issue is due to the sum_f function's recursive calls. The sum_f function for a large range like 1e18 would require O(1) memo entries (since sum_f is just f(1e18)), but for a large range like 1e18 to 1e18 +1e5, the sum_f function would require O(1e5) recursive calls, leading to O(1e5) entries in the memo.

Thus, the problem is with sum_f's approach of splitting the range into two halves. This approach is not feasible for large ranges.

To fix this, the sum_f function must be replaced with a more efficient way to compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b].

Let me think again about the sum of f(k) over [a, b]. Since each f(k) is 0 or 1, this sum is the count of 1's in the range. So, the problem is to count the number of k in [a, b] where f(k) = 1.

Now, f(k) is defined recursively. To count the number of 1's in [a, b], we need to compute how many times the recursive function f(k) returns 1 for k in that range.

But how?

Another Idea: Since f(k) is computed recursively, and each call to f(k) depends on f(k-1) and f(k//2), perhaps we can model this with memoization and count the number of 1's directly.

For example, for a range [a, b], we can compute f(a), f(a+1), ..., f(b) and sum them up. But for large ranges, this is not feasible.

But with memoization, and for each k in the range, the computation of f(k) takes O(log k) time and adds O(log k) entries to the memo. For a range of size m, this would be O(m log k) time and O(m log k) memory, which is not feasible for m=1e5 and log k=60.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the original memoization method but replace the sum_f function with an iterative approach that computes the sum directly without splitting into halves. For example, compute each f(k) in the range [a, b] and sum them. But again, for large ranges, this is impossible.

But wait, the sum for even and odd ranges reduces the problem to summing f(k) over ranges of k's that are approximately half the original range. For example, even m's contribute to k = m/2, and odd m's contribute to k = (m-1)/2. Thus, the problem of summing over a large range of m's is transformed into summing over two smaller ranges of k's.

This is similar to the approach in the previous code, which splits the sum into even and odd m's and computes the sum of f(k) over the corresponding k ranges. But when the k ranges are large, the sum_f function is recursively split into halves, which is not feasible.

Thus, the solution is to avoid using the sum_f function and instead compute the sum of f(k) for a range [a, b] by using the same approach as the original problem: split into even and odd k's, and compute their contributions recursively.

Wait, but for the sum of f(k) over [a, b], we can split into even and odd k's, and for each group, compute the sum of f(k) by further splitting their corresponding k ranges. This way, each recursive call reduces the problem size by approximately half.

For example, the sum of f(k) from a to b can be split into:

sum of f(k) where k is even in [a, b], and sum of f(k) where k is odd in [a, b].

For even k, we can express them as k = 2m. Then f(k) = f(2m) = f(2m-1) XOR f(m). But this doesn't seem to help.

Alternatively, since even and odd k's are handled differently, perhaps each even k contributes f(k) which depends on f(k-1) and f(k/2), and similarly for odd k.

But this seems like it's leading us back to the original problem.

Another Idea: Since the sum of f(k) over a range can be split into even and odd k's, and each of these ranges can be transformed into ranges of m's (k/2 and (k-1)/2), perhaps we can model this with a recursive function that processes these ranges.

For example, the sum of f(k) from a to b can be computed as:

sum_even = sum of f(2m) for m in [even_a, even_b]

sum_odd = sum of f(2m+1) for m in [odd_a, odd_b]

sum_even and sum_odd can be computed by transforming into sums of f(2m-1) XOR f(m) and f(2m) XOR f(m), respectively.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, note that for even k:

k = 2m → f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f(m) = f(2m-1) XOR f(m)

For odd k:

k = 2m +1 → f(k) = f(2m) XOR f(m)

Thus, the sum of f(k) over a range can be expressed in terms of sums of f(2m-1), f(m), and f(2m).

But this seems to complicate things further.

At this point, I'm stuck. I need to find a different approach.

Let me look for hints in the problem's sample input and note.

In the sample input 2:

n=2, a=[1,0]

The sum from 3 to 10 is 5. The sequence for m>2:

m=3: a_3 = f(1) =1

m=4: a_4 = f(2) =1

m=5: a_5 =f(2) =1

m=6: a_6 =f(3) =0

m=7: a_7 =f(3) =0

m=8: a_8 =f(4) =1

m=9: a_9 =f(4) =1

m=10: a_10 =f(5) =0

The sum from 3 to 10 is 1+1+1+0+0+1+1+0 =5.

The sum for even m in 3-10 (m=4,6,8,10) is 1+0+1+0=2.

The sum for odd m (3,5,7,9) is 1+1+0+1=3.

Total is 5.

The sum of f(k) for even m/2 and (m-1)/2:

For even m:

m=4: k=2 → f(2)=1

m=6: k=3 → f(3)=0

m=8: k=4 → f(4)=1

m=10: k=5 → f(5)=0

Sum_even = 1+0+1+0=2.

For odd m:

m=3 → k=1 → f(1)=1

m=5 → k=2 → f(2)=1

m=7 →k=3 → f(3)=0

m=9 →k=4 → f(4)=1

Sum_odd=1+1+0+1=3.

So the sum is 2+3=5.

Thus, the approach of splitting into even and odd m's and summing f(k) over the corresponding k ranges works.

The key is to compute sum_f(a, b) for certain k ranges. But how to compute sum_f(a, b) efficiently.

Thus, the solution is:

For the sum of f(k) from a to b, use a recursive function that splits the range into even and odd k's and computes their contributions.

But wait, no. The sum of f(k) from a to b is the sum of f(k) for each k in [a, b]. The previous approach for a_m is based on m's parity, but here we're dealing with k's parity.

Alternatively, for each k in [a, b], compute f(k) using the recursive function, and sum them. But this would require O(b-a+1) calls to f(k), which is not feasible for large ranges.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding a way to compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b] efficiently, given that each f(k) can be computed in O(log k) time with memoization.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

The previous code uses a recursive sum_f(a, b) that splits the range into two halves. For example, sum_f(a, b) = sum_f(a, mid) + sum_f(mid+1, b). This approach leads to O(b-a+1) recursive calls for a range of size O(b-a+1), which is not feasible for large ranges.

To fix this, we need to compute the sum without splitting the range into individual elements. For example, by finding a way to compute the sum in O(1) time for certain ranges, or in O(log k) time per query.

But how?

Perhaps the key is to realize that the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b] can be computed using the same approach as for a_m. That is, for even and odd k's, split them into their own ranges and compute the sum recursively.

But how to model this.

For example, when summing f(k) from a to b:

For even k: k = 2m → f(k) = f(2m-1) XOR f(m)

For odd k: k = 2m+1 → f(k) = f(2m) XOR f(m)

But this doesn't directly help in summing.

Another Idea: For each k, f(k) can be expressed as the XOR of a certain chain of previous values. For example, f(k) = f(k-1) XOR f( floor(k/2) ), which can be further unrolled as f(k-2) XOR f( floor((k-1)/2) ) XOR f( floor(k/2) ), and so on until reaching the base case. This creates a chain of XOR operations that may have a pattern.

But this seems too vague to exploit.

At this point, I'm out of ideas. The only feasible solution I can think of is to use memoization with a dictionary per test case, but avoid splitting the sum into individual elements by handling even and odd ranges in a way that reduces the problem size logarithmically.

Thus, the final approach is:

1. For each test case, compute the prefix_xor array for the initial n elements.

2. For elements in the range [l, r] that are <=n, add their sum.

3. For elements >n, split into even and odd m's and compute their contributions by summing f(k) over the corresponding k ranges.

4. For each k range, compute the sum recursively using a helper function that, given a range [a, b], returns the sum of f(k) from a to b.

5. To compute the sum recursively, split the range [a, b] into even and odd k's, and compute their sums by transforming them into smaller ranges. For example:

sum_f(a, b) = sum_even_f(a_even, b_even) + sum_odd_f(a_odd, b_odd)

where sum_even_f is the sum of f(k) for even k in [a, b], which can be transformed into sum_f(a_even//2, b_even//2).

Similarly, sum_odd_f is the sum of f(k) for odd k in [a, b], which can be transformed into sum_f(a_odd//2, b_odd//2).

Wait, this is a promising approach.

For example:

Even k's: k = 2m. Then, the sum of even k's from a to b is equivalent to the sum of f(2m) for m in [m1, m2], which is sum_f(m1, m2) where each m is k/2.

But f(2m) depends on f(2m-1) and f(m), but this may not help.

Alternatively, if we can find a way to express the sum of f(k) for even k's in terms of sums of f(m) for m = k/2.

But this is not straightforward.

Another Idea: Since a_m for even m is f(k) where k = m/2, and a_m for odd m is f(k) where k = (m-1)/2, the sum of a_m's for m >n is equal to the sum of f(k) for all k = m/2 (even m) and k = (m-1)/2 (odd m). Thus, the sum of a_m's is equivalent to the sum of f(k) for certain k's, which can be grouped into ranges.

But when you have to sum f(k) for those ranges, how can you compute that sum efficiently?

The answer is to use the same approach recursively. For each range of k's, split into even and odd k's, and compute their sums by transforming into ranges of m's.

Thus, the sum of f(k) from a to b can be computed as:

sum_even = sum_f(a_even, b_even) where even k's are 2m, and sum_even is sum_f(m_start, m_end), where m_start = a_even//2 and m_end = b_even//2.

sum_odd = sum_f(a_odd, b_odd) where odd k's are 2m+1, and sum_odd is sum_f(m_start, m_end), where m_start = (a_odd-1)/2 and m_end = (b_odd-1)/2.

But this is not correct. Because the f(k) for even and odd k's are computed differently. But perhaps for the sum of f(k), we can split the range into even and odd k's, and for each group, express the sum in terms of sums over smaller ranges.

For example, the sum of f(k) from a to b can be split into:

sum_even = sum of f(k) for even k in [a, b]

sum_odd = sum of f(k) for odd k in [a, b]

sum_even + sum_odd = total sum.

For sum_even:

even k = 2m, so m ranges from a_even//2 to b_even//2.

But f(2m) = f(2m-1) XOR f(m)

But how to express this sum.

Alternatively, perhaps for even k=2m, the sum of f(2m) from m=m1 to m=m2 is equal to the sum of f(2m) for m in [m1, m2], which can be transformed into sum of (f(2m-1) XOR f(m)) for m in [m1, m2].

This seems to complicate things further.

Thus, I'm stuck. The only feasible solution given time constraints is to implement the initial approach but with a more efficient sum_f function that avoids recursive splitting.

But how?

After much consideration, the correct approach seems to be:

For each test case:

1. Compute the prefix_xor for the first n elements.

2. For the range [l, r], compute the sum of elements <=n.

3. For elements >n, split into even and odd m's, then compute the sum of f(k) for the corresponding k ranges.

4. To compute the sum of f(k) over a range [a, b], use a recursive function that splits into even and odd k's and accumulates the sum.

But the key is to memoize the sum of f(k) for ranges, not individual k's.

Thus, the sum of f(k) from a to b can be computed as follows:

def sum_f(a, b):

    if a > b:

        return 0

    if a == b:

        return f(a)

    # Split into even and odd k's

    even_start = a if a % 2 == 0 else a + 1

    even_end = b if b % 2 == 0 else b - 1

    sum_even = sum_f(even_start // 2, even_end // 2)

    odd_start = a if a % 2 == 1 else a + 1

    odd_end = b if b % 2 == 1 else b - 1

    sum_odd = sum_f((odd_start - 1) // 2, (odd_end - 1) // 2)

    return sum_even + sum_odd

This way, each call to sum_f reduces the problem size by roughly half. For example, sum_f(a, b) is split into sum_f over even and odd ranges, which are then transformed into ranges of m's that are roughly half of a and b. Thus, the depth of recursion is O(log (b-a+1)), and the number of memoized sum ranges is O(log (b-a+1)).

But to implement this, we need to memoize the sum_f function for ranges [a, b].

However, this approach is not correct because f(k) for even and odd k's is not the same as f(m) where m is k/2 or (k-1)/2. Thus, the sum of f(k) for even k's is not the same as the sum of f(m) for m in k/2 ranges.

But given the time constraints and the problem's difficulty, this is the approach I will implement and test.
