Okay, let's see. The problem is about counting the number of valid sequences of operations where each step involves XORing one of P, Q, R with a_i, such that after each step, all three variables P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct. Hmm. So after each action, P, Q, R must all be equal? Because if they are not pairwise distinct, then all three must be the same. Because pairwise distinct means all pairs are different. Wait, no. Wait, the main rule says that after each action, all three numbers P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct. So the pairwise distinct condition is when all pairs are distinct. So the negation is that at least two are equal. So after each action, it's allowed as long as there's at least two that are equal. Wait, but the problem statement says "not pairwise distinct". So pairwise distinct would mean that P≠Q, P≠R, Q≠R. So the negation is that at least two are equal. So after each step, P, Q, R must have at least two equal. Wait, but that's possible in two scenarios: either all three are equal, or exactly two are equal. So the main rule allows both cases. But how do the operations affect the state?

Wait, but the initial state is P=Q=R=0. So after each step, when you process a_i, you choose which variable to XOR with a_i. Then, after that step, the three variables must not be pairwise distinct. So the way to model this is to track the possible states of (P, Q, R) such that after each operation, they are not pairwise distinct.

But considering that the variables are P, Q, R, and each step updates one of them, perhaps we can model this as a state transition problem. The key is to represent the state in such a way that we can efficiently compute the number of valid sequences.

Let's think about the possible states. Let's say that after processing the first i elements, the current state must satisfy that P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct. So for each step, the possible transitions depend on the previous state and the current a_i.

But how can we model this efficiently? Let's see. Let's think about the possible cases for the state:

Case 1: All three variables are equal. So P=Q=R. Then, after XORing any one of them with a_i, what happens?

Suppose the current value is x. Then, after XORing P with a_i, P becomes x^a_i. Q and R are still x. So the new state is (x^a_i, x, x). Are these pairwise distinct? Let's see. The new P is x^a_i, Q and R are x. So P is different from Q and R unless x^a_i == x. That would require a_i to be 0, which is possible. But in general, if a_i is not 0, then after XORing P, the new P is different from Q and R. So then Q and R are equal, but P is different. So in that case, the three variables are not pairwise distinct because Q and R are equal. So even if P is different, the state is allowed. So the main rule is satisfied.

Wait, the main rule requires that after each action, all three are not pairwise distinct. So even if two are equal and the third is different, that's allowed. So in the example where after XORing P, we have P = x^a_i and Q=R=x. Then, P is different from Q and R. So Q and R are equal, but P is different. So pairwise, we have P≠Q, P≠R, Q=R. So the pairwise distinct is not all three pairs. Therefore, the main rule is satisfied. Because the pairwise distinct condition would require that all three pairs are distinct, but here two pairs are equal. So the main rule allows this.

Ah, that's a crucial point. So the main rule is that after each action, the three variables are not all pairwise distinct. So as long as at least two are equal, it's allowed.

So, the state can be in one of two possible scenarios:

Either all three variables are equal (state A), or exactly two are equal (state B). Because if all three are equal, that's state A. If two are equal and the third is different, that's state B.

Wait, but when we process the next element, we choose which variable to XOR with a_i. So the transitions from state A and state B to the next states can be considered.

So the initial state is (0,0,0), which is state A. Then, for each step, we process a_i, choose which variable to XOR, and check whether the new state is allowed.

But modeling the state as either state A or state B might not be sufficient. Because state B can have different possibilities: which two variables are equal, and what their values are. For example, if after processing some elements, P equals Q but R is different, then in state B (two variables equal). But the next operation could XOR R, leading to R being equal to P and Q, but then the state would be A again.

Hmm, but perhaps the exact values of the variables don't matter, only the relations between them. But that's unlikely, because the choice of which variable to XOR affects the next state.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the state in terms of the XORs of the variables. For example, the state can be characterized by the current values of P, Q, R, but that's impossible because the values can be up to 1e9, leading to a very large state space.

Therefore, perhaps there's a pattern or invariant that allows us to model the problem in terms of transitions between a small number of states, regardless of the actual values.

Let me think about possible transitions.

Suppose the current state is A: all variables equal to x. Then, when processing a_i, we can choose to XOR any of the variables. Let's say we XOR P. Then the new P is x ^ a_i, Q and R remain x. So the new state is (x^a_i, x, x). So in this case, Q and R are equal to x, and P is x^a_i. So if x^a_i == x (i.e., a_i is 0), then all three are equal again. Otherwise, the new state is B, where two variables are equal (Q and R), and P is different.

But if the a_i is not zero, then XORing any variable in state A would result in two variables being x and the third being x^a_i. So the new state is B, where two variables are equal (the ones not XORed) and the third is different. Unless a_i is zero, in which case all three remain equal.

So for each step in state A, if a_i is not zero, XORing any of the three variables leads to state B. But if a_i is zero, then XORing any variable leaves the state as A.

Now, suppose the current state is B: two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's say P equals Q, but R is different. So P = Q = x, R = y, where y != x.

If we process a_i, we can choose to XOR any of the three variables.

Case 1: XOR P. Then P becomes x ^ a_i. Q remains x, R remains y. Now, the new state is (x^a_i, x, y). Are there two variables equal here? Let's see. If x^a_i == x, then a_i must be zero, so P becomes x. Then Q is x, R is y. So P and Q are equal. But y could be different. So again, two variables equal.

If a_i is not zero, then x^a_i is different from x. So new variables are (x^a_i, x, y). Are there any two equal here? Not unless x^a_i equals y, which depends on previous state and a_i.

Wait, but in the current state B, R is y, which is different from x. So after XORing P, which was x, the new P is x ^ a_i. So in this case, the new variables are (x^a_i, x, y). Now, whether any two are equal depends on whether x^a_i equals x (which requires a_i=0), or x^a_i equals y. 

But this seems complicated. So perhaps when in state B, the next state after XORing a variable depends on the specific a_i and the current values.

This suggests that modeling the state transitions directly might be difficult unless there's a pattern that allows grouping certain possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find that in state B, the three variables must form a certain invariant. Let me think.

Suppose in state B, two variables are equal (say P=Q=x), and R is y. Then, what is the relationship between x and y?

Wait, the previous steps must have allowed transitions to this state. For example, perhaps in state B, the three variables can be represented as (x, x, x ^ a_i) for some a_i, but this may not be general.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the problem in terms of the possible differences between the variables. For example, the state could be determined by the values of P ^ Q, Q ^ R, and R ^ P. But again, this might not lead to a manageable state space.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid sequences can be determined based on whether all a_i up to a certain point are zero, or some other condition. But given that a_i can be arbitrary, this seems unlikely.

Another approach: Let's consider the problem for small n and see if there's a pattern.

Looking at the sample input:

First test case:

3
1 7 9

The output is 3. The valid sequences are all three choosing the same variable each time (PPP, QQQ, RRR). Because after each step, all three variables are equal. For example, after first step, P=1, Q=R=0. Then, the next step would require that after processing 7, adding to P would make P=1^7=6, Q=0, R=0. Then, after the second step, the variables are 6, 0, 0. Which is allowed because Q and R are equal. Then the third step: adding 9 to P again. So P=6^9= 15, Q=0, R=0. Again, allowed. So the entire sequence is allowed.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, the valid sequences are PPP, QQQ, RRR. Which implies that after each step, all three variables are equal. So for the first sample, even though choosing PPP leads to each step having all three variables equal, but in the other options like PPQ, after the second step, P would be 1^7=6, Q would be 7, R is 0. So variables are 6,7,0. All pairwise distinct. Which violates the main rule. So those sequences are invalid.

Wait, but the sample input's first case has output 3, which is exactly the sequences where all operations are the same. So in this case, the only valid sequences are those where all operations assign to the same variable. Because otherwise, after the first step, two variables would be 0, but the third would be 1. Then, when processing the second element (7), XORing, say, Q (0 ^7=7). Then variables are 1,7,0. All pairwise distinct. Which is invalid.

So in order for all steps to be valid, the variables must always be all equal. Because if at any step, two variables are equal but the third is different, then choosing to XOR the different one in the next step may lead to all three being different again. For example:

Suppose current state is (x, x, y). If we XOR y with a_i, then the new state is (x, x, y^a_i). For this to be allowed, at least two variables must be equal. So x and x are equal. So regardless of y^a_i, this is allowed. But if we XOR x (the first variable) with a_i, then new variables are (x^a_i, x, y). Now, x^a_i may be different from x and y, so we need to check whether two variables are equal. For example, if a_i is such that x^a_i == x, then a_i is zero, and variables are (x, x, y). So allowed. Otherwise, if x^a_i != x and x^a_i != y, then the variables are (x^a_i, x, y). Now, are any two equal? x and x are equal (the second and first variables? Wait, no. x^a_i is the first variable, the second is x. So if x^a_i is not equal to x (a_i !=0), then the first variable is different from the second, and third is y. So unless the third is equal to either of them, this would result in three distinct variables, which would be invalid.

Ah, right. So in this case, if the current state is (x, x, y) where y != x, and we choose to XOR the first variable (x) with a_i, which is non-zero. Then the new variables are (x ^ a_i, x, y). For this to be allowed, we need at least two variables to be equal. So either x^a_i == x (a_i is zero), which is not the case, or x^a_i == y. Otherwise, the three variables would all be distinct (x^a_i, x, y) which is invalid.

So in this scenario, the action is allowed only if x^a_i equals x (a_i is zero) or x^a_i equals y. Otherwise, it's invalid.

This complicates the transitions because the validity depends on the actual value of a_i and the current state. Therefore, modeling this for arbitrary a_i is challenging.

But perhaps there's a way to model the problem by considering that the only allowed sequences are those where all operations are the same variable (as in the first sample), and some other cases when the a_i's are zero or have certain relations. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to cases where after each step, all three variables are equal. Because any other case might lead to possible invalid transitions.

Wait, in the first sample, the only valid sequences are those where all operations are on the same variable. Let's see why. Suppose you process the first element by choosing P. So P=1, Q and R are 0. Then, the variables are (1,0,0). Since Q and R are equal, this is allowed. Next step, you choose Q. Then Q becomes 0^7=7. Now variables are (1,7,0). All pairwise distinct. So this is invalid. Therefore, this sequence is invalid. Therefore, in the first step, after choosing P, in the next step, you cannot choose Q or R unless the a_i is such that the new variables are allowed.

But in the first sample's first step, a_i is 1. So the variables after first step are (1,0,0). Then, the next a_i is 7.

Suppose in the second step, we choose to XOR Q. Then Q becomes 0^7=7. Variables are (1,7,0). All are distinct. Which is invalid. So the sequence PPQ is invalid.

But if in the second step, you choose P again. Then P becomes 1^7=6. Variables are (6,0,0). So Q and R are equal. Which is allowed. Then third step, you must choose P again. So variables become 6^9=15, 0,0. Which is allowed. So PPP is valid.

So the only valid sequences are those where all steps are assigned to the same variable. Because any deviation would require that in the next steps, the variables are handled in a way that maintains the conditions.

But why is that the case in the first sample? Because each a_i is non-zero, and the sum (XOR) of the variables after each step must not allow for transitions where two variables are the same but the third is different. For example, in the first sample, after the first step, variables are (1,0,0). If in the next step, you choose Q, then you get (1,7,0), which is invalid. So you have to choose P again. But even if you choose Q or R again, but that would leave the variables as (1,0^7=7,0) which is (1,7,0), which is invalid. Wait, no. If you choose R in the second step, then R becomes 0^7=7. Variables are (1,0,7). All pairwise distinct. Which is invalid.

So the only valid option after the first step is to XOR the same variable again (P), leading to (6,0,0). Then, again, XOR P in the third step.

So the conclusion is that for each a_i, if we choose to XOR the same variable each time, then after each step, the variables are all equal (if the same variable is chosen each time). Because:

Initially, P=Q=R=0.

After first step, choosing to XOR P, then P becomes 0^a_1, Q and R remain 0. So after the first step, variables are (a_1, 0, 0). Which is allowed because Q and R are equal.

But if in the next step, we again choose P, then P becomes a_1^a_2. Q and R are 0. So variables are (a_1^a_2, 0, 0). Which is allowed.

If we continue this way, after each step, variables are (x, 0, 0), where x is the cumulative XOR of the first k elements. Since Q and R remain 0, which are equal, the state is allowed.

But wait, after step 2, variables are (x,0,0). So the next step, if we choose Q, then Q becomes 0^a_3. Variables are (x, a_3, 0). Which has Q and R different, and P is x. So if x != a_3 and a_3 != 0, then all three are different, which is invalid. But if x equals a_3, then P and Q are equal, so the state is allowed.

But in this case, the only way to proceed is to have the new variables have at least two equal. So in this scenario, choosing Q in the third step would be allowed only if x equals a_3 or a_3 equals 0.

But in the first sample, a_3 is 9, which is non-zero and not equal to x (which is 1^7=6). So in that case, choosing Q would lead to (6,9,0), which is invalid.

So the only way to have valid sequences is to choose the same variable each time. Thus, the number of valid sequences is 3 (one for each variable).

But why is that the case when some a_i's are zero?

For example, if a_i is zero, then XORing any variable doesn't change it. So if in a step, the a_i is zero, then XORing any variable leaves it as before. So the variables remain the same.

But how does that affect the state transitions?

Hmm. Let's think about the second sample input:

4
179 1 1 179

The output is 9. According to the note, valid sequences include PPPP, PPPQ, etc. So the sequences can vary in their choices, as long as after each step, the variables are not all pairwise distinct.

So what's different here?

Let's see. Let's take the sequence PPPQ. Let's walk through each step.

Step 1: Process 179. Assign to P. Now P=179, Q=0, R=0. Variables (179,0,0). Allowed because Q and R are equal.

Step 2: Process 1. Assign to P again. Now P=179^1=178, Q=0, R=0. Variables (178,0,0). Allowed.

Step 3: Process 1. Assign to P again. Now P=178^1=179, Q=0, R=0. Allowed.

Step 4: Process 179. Assign to Q. Now Q=0^179=179. Variables (179,179,0). So P and Q are equal. Allowed.

So this sequence is valid.

So in this case, even though the first three steps are P and the fourth is Q, the variables after each step are allowed.

So how is this possible?

After step 4, variables are (179, 179, 0). But the fourth step's action is to assign to Q. So after step 4, P is 179 (from step 3), Q becomes 0 ^179=179, and R remains 0. So variables are (179,179,0). P and Q are equal, so allowed.

So the main idea is that as long as after each step, at least two variables are equal, the sequence is valid.

So the problem is to count all possible sequences of choices (for each step, choose which variable to XOR) such that after each step, the three variables are not all pairwise distinct (i.e., at least two are equal).

Now, the key is to find a way to model the possible transitions between states, considering that each step's choice depends on the current state and a_i.

Let's model the states as follows:

At any step, the variables can be in one of two possible cases:

1. All three variables are equal (state A).

2. Exactly two variables are equal (state B).

In state B, the third variable may be different. But we need to track which two are equal and the value of the third. However, this seems too complex, but perhaps there's a way to model it without tracking specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps when in state B, the variables are in such a way that two are equal to x, and the third is x ^ s, where s is some value derived from the a_i's processed so far. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that when in state B, the two equal variables are x, and the third is x ^ s. Then, when processing a new a_i, XORing one of the variables may transition to state A or another state B.

But this requires that s is some cumulative value.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem with dynamic programming, where the state is represented by whether we are in state A or B, and some parameters that capture the necessary information.

Let's try this approach.

Let's define two possible states:

- State A: all variables are equal.

- State B: exactly two variables are equal.

But in state B, we need to track which pair of variables is equal (e.g., P=Q, Q=R, or P=R) and the value of the third variable. But tracking the third variable's value is impractical for large a_i.

Wait, but perhaps when we are in state B, the third variable's value is determined by the XOR of a certain sum. For example, suppose that in state B, two variables are equal to x, and the third is x ^ s. Then, s would be the XOR of some subset of the a_i's. But how to track this?

Alternatively, suppose that when in state B, the third variable's value is the XOR of the sum of a certain set of a_i's. Then, perhaps s can be tracked as a parameter. But again, this may not be feasible for large n.

Hmm. Let's think again. Let's model the state as either being in state A or B, and track some variables that allow us to compute transitions.

Let's consider that when in state A, all variables are equal to x. Then, for the next a_i, we can choose to XOR any of the three variables. The result depends on whether a_i is zero.

If a_i is zero, then XORing any variable leaves x ^ 0 = x. So the state remains A.

If a_i is not zero, then XORing any variable (say P) leads to P = x ^ a_i, while Q and R remain x. So the new state is B, where P is x^a_i and Q and R are x. So the two variables (Q and R) are equal, and P is different.

Now, in state B, we have two variables equal to x, and one equal to y = x ^ a_i. Then, when processing the next a_j, the transitions depend on which variable we choose to XOR.

So in state B, when processing a new a_j, we can choose to XOR any of the three variables. Let's consider each choice:

Case 1: XOR one of the two equal variables (say Q). Then Q becomes x ^ a_j. The new variables are P=y, Q = x^a_j, R = x. Now, we need to check if any two are equal.

If x^a_j == y, then Q and P are equal. So the state would be B again, with Q and P equal (value y), and R remains x. But this depends on a_j.

Case 2: XOR the third variable (P = y). Then P becomes y ^ a_j. The variables are P = y^a_j, Q = x, R = x. So after this, Q and R are equal. So whether P^a_j equals x or not determines if there are two equal variables.

But without knowing x, y, and a_j, this is impossible to track.

This suggests that the state transitions in state B depend on the current a_j and the previous a_i's. But this would make the problem impossible to model in a dynamic programming approach unless there's a pattern that allows us to collapse the state into a few parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the problem by considering the parity of the number of times a certain variable has been XORed. Or some other invariant.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that for the variables to have at least two equal after each step, the only valid sequences are those where all XOR operations are applied to the same variable, or there are certain conditions where the XOR of some a_i's cancels out.

But this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, let's consider that when we are in state B (two variables equal, third different), then the next operation can only XOR one of the two equal variables. Because XORing the third variable (which is different) could lead to all three being distinct.

Wait, for example, in state B: variables are x, x, y (y != x).

If we XOR y (third variable) with a_i, then y becomes y ^ a_i. The new variables are x, x, y^a_i. Are there two equal variables? Yes: the first two are x. So the state remains B, regardless of a_i. So XORing the third variable is always allowed in state B.

Similarly, if we XOR one of the two equal variables (say, the first x) with a_i, the new variables are x^a_i, x, y. Now, whether any two are equal depends on whether x^a_i == x (a_i is 0), x^a_i == y, or x == y.

If a_i is 0, then x^a_i is x, so variables are x, x, y. So still B.

If a_i is such that x^a_i == y, then the new variables are y, x, y. So variables are y, x, y. So two are equal (first and third). So state B.

If x^a_i is different from both x and y, then variables are x^a_i, x, y. All three are different. Which is invalid.

So in this case, XORing one of the equal variables is allowed only if a_i is 0 or x^a_i equals y.

But y is the previous third variable, which was x^a_prev (assuming that the previous step was to transition from A to B by XORing a variable with a_prev). For example, if we were in state A (x) and XORed P with a_prev to get x^a_prev, then the state B variables are x^a_prev (P), x (Q), x (R). So y = x^a_prev.

So when in state B after that, the third variable is x^a_prev.

Now, when processing a_i, if we choose to XOR Q (which is x), then Q becomes x^a_i. The new variables are x^a_prev, x^a_i, x.

To be allowed, at least two must be equal. So possibilities:

Either x^a_prev == x^a_i (i.e., a_prev == a_i), or x^a_i == x (a_i == 0), or x^a_prev == x (which is possible only if a_prev ==0).

But this depends on previous a_prev and current a_i. So again, it's complicated.

But perhaps there's a way to model the transitions with two parameters: the current state (A or B) and a value s, which is the XOR of all a_i's processed so far in a certain way.

Alternatively, let's consider that in state A, all variables are x. So the XOR of any variable is x. So the possible transitions from state A are:

For each a_i:

- If a_i is 0: then XORing any variable leaves x. So state remains A. So for each step where a_i is 0, there are 3 choices, and the state remains A.

- If a_i is not 0: then XORing any variable will transition to state B. So there are 3 choices leading to state B.

Now, in state B, after processing a_i (non-zero), the variables are x^a_i, x, x. So two variables are x, and one is x^a_i.

Now, when in state B, for the next step a_j:

If we XOR one of the two equal variables (x), then the new value is x^a_j. The other equal variable remains x. The third variable is x^a_i (from previous step). So the new variables are x^a_j, x, x^a_i.

For this to be allowed, at least two must be equal. So possibilities:

x^a_j == x → a_j is 0 → x^a_j is x, so variables are x, x, x^a_i. If x^a_i is x (i.e., a_i is 0), then all are x. But a_i was non-zero, so this is not possible. So variables are x, x, x^a_i (which is not x). So two variables are equal (x and x), which is allowed.

Or x^a_j == x^a_i → which implies a_j = a_i.

Or x == x^a_i → which implies a_i =0, but a_i was non-zero.

So, if in state B and we choose to XOR one of the equal variables (x) with a_j, the new variables are x^a_j, x, x^a_i.

For this to be allowed, either a_j is 0 (so x^a_j is x) → variables (x, x, x^a_i) → two equal, allowed.

Or x^a_j equals x^a_i → a_j =a_i.

Otherwise, variables are x^a_j, x, x^a_i → which could be all distinct if a_j is not 0 and a_j !=a_i.

In that case, the action is invalid.

So this suggests that when in state B, XORing one of the equal variables is allowed only if a_j is 0 or a_j equals a_i.

But this is complicated.

Alternatively, when in state B, XORing the third variable (which is x^a_i) with a_j will make it x^a_i^a_j. The other two variables are x. So the new variables are x, x, x^a_i^a_j. So two are equal (x), which is allowed. So regardless of a_j, XORing the third variable is always allowed. So in state B, XORing the third variable is a valid choice, leading to state B again, with the third variable now being x^a_i^a_j.

So for each step in state B, XORing the third variable gives a valid transition.

Similarly, XORing one of the equal variables may or may not be valid, depending on a_j.

But this seems too case-based to model.

Another observation: when in state B, the third variable is the XOR of the sum of certain a_i's. For example, after transitioning from state A to B by XORing a variable with a_1, the third variable is a_1. Then, when processing a_2 and XORing the third variable, it becomes a_1^a_2. Then, processing a_3 and XORing the third variable again, it becomes a_1^a_2^a_3. So the third variable is the cumulative XOR of some subset of the a_i's.

But how does this help in modeling the problem?

Alternatively, let's think of the third variable as the sum of the XORs of the a_i's assigned to it, and the two equal variables as the sum of the XORs of the a_i's assigned to them. But this seems too vague.

Perhaps there's a way to model the state using two variables: the current state (A or B) and a certain value that captures the necessary information for transitions. For example, in state B, the third variable's value (the XOR of a certain sequence of a_i's) could be tracked.

But given that a_i can be up to 1e9 and the sequence length up to 2e5, it's impossible to track this for all possible values.

So perhaps the key is to find that the number of valid sequences is equal to 3 times the product of certain factors for each a_i. For example, when all a_i's are zero, the number of valid sequences is 3^n. But when some a_i's are non-zero, the number of valid sequences is determined by the positions where a_i is zero.

Alternatively, for each a_i, if a_i is zero, then there are 3 choices that lead to state A (since XORing any variable leaves the state as A), but if a_i is non-zero, then the number of choices depends on the current state.

But this is getting complicated.

Let's think about the transitions again. We can model the DP with two states: A and B. For each step, we track the number of valid sequences that end in state A or B.

Initially, we have one sequence in state A (the initial state), and zero in state B.

For each a_i, we compute the transitions:

- From state A:

   If a_i is zero: all three choices (P, Q, R) lead to state A. So the number of sequences is multiplied by 3.

   If a_i is non-zero: all three choices lead to state B. So the sequences in A contribute to B.

- From state B:

   If a_i is zero:

      XORing the third variable (which is in state B) results in the third variable becoming x^0 =x, so variables become x, x, x. So state A. But also, XORing one of the equal variables (x) results in x^0 =x, so variables remain x, x, x^a_i_prev (but a_i is zero, so x^0 =x. So the third variable becomes x. So all variables are x. So state A. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, in state B, the variables are x, x, y. Where y is x^s for some s.

If a_i is zero:

   If we choose to XOR the third variable (y), then y becomes y ^0 =y. So variables remain x, x, y. Which is state B. But a_i is zero, so no change.

   If we choose to XOR one of the equal variables (x), then x becomes x ^0 =x. So variables remain x, x, y. So state B.

   So in this case, all three choices lead to state B. So for a_i=0 and current state B, there are 3 choices that leave the state as B.

But this contradicts the previous thought. Hmm. So maybe when a_i is zero and in state B, XORing any variable leaves the state as B. Because XORing any variable with zero leaves it unchanged. So variables remain as x, x, y. So state B.

So for a_i=0 and state B: 3 choices, stay in B.

If a_i is non-zero and state B:

   XORing the third variable (y) leads to y^a_i. The new variables are x, x, y^a_i. So state B.

   XORing one of the equal variables (x) leads to x^a_i. So new variables are x^a_i, x, y. For this to be allowed, at least two must be equal. So either x^a_i == x (a_i=0, which is not the case), x^a_i == y (possible), or x == y (which would mean that state B is actually state A, which is not possible).

So, the only possibility is x^a_i == y. So, in this case, the new variables are (x^a_i, x, y). Since y =x^s (from previous steps), this requires that x^a_i = y =x^s → s =a_i. But how to track this?

This seems to be impossible to model without knowing the actual value of y. Hence, this approach is not feasible.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to model the DP with two states: A and B. For each step, the transitions depend on whether a_i is zero or not.

But how?

Let me try to formalize this:

Define dp[i][A] as the number of valid sequences up to step i ending in state A.

Similarly, dp[i][B] as the number of valid sequences ending in state B.

For the initial state, dp[0][A] = 1, dp[0][B] = 0.

For each step i from 1 to n:

   if a_i ==0:

      From state A:

         3 choices (assign to any of P/Q/R), each leading to state A.

         So dp[i][A] += dp[i-1][A] *3.

      From state B:

         Each choice (assign to any of the three variables) leads to state B.

         Because XORing any variable with 0 leaves it unchanged. So variables remain in state B.

         So dp[i][B] += dp[i-1][B] *3.

   else:

      From state A:

         3 choices leading to state B.

         So dp[i][B] += dp[i-1][A] *3.

      From state B:

         How many choices are valid?

         For each choice in state B:

             - XORing the third variable: always allowed, leading to state B.

             - XORing one of the two equal variables: allowed only if the result is such that at least two variables are equal.

             As discussed earlier, this is allowed only if a_i equals the previous s (the value of the third variable's XOR sum), which is not tracked.

         But this seems impossible to model without knowing s.

Wait, but perhaps the number of valid choices from state B when a_i is non-zero is 1. Because XORing the third variable is always allowed (since it leaves two variables equal), but XORing the other variables may not be allowed. But without knowing s, how can we determine this?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid choices from state B when a_i is non-zero is 2. For example, XORing the third variable is always allowed (1 choice), and XORing one of the two equal variables is allowed only if a_i is equal to the current difference between the third variable and the equal variables.

But without tracking that difference, this is impossible.

This suggests that the initial approach of using two states (A and B) is insufficient, because the transitions from state B depend on the actual value of the variables.

Therefore, this problem requires a different approach.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that after each step, the three variables must not be all pairwise distinct. So, after each step, at least two variables are equal.

Now, the key observation is that the order in which we assign the XOR operations must ensure that after each step, at least two variables are equal. Let's think about the possible ways this can happen.

There are two possibilities:

1. All three variables are equal. Then, any assignment to any variable will either leave them all equal (if a_i is 0), or two variables will remain equal and the third will be different (if a_i is not 0).

2. Exactly two variables are equal. Then, any assignment must result in at least two variables being equal.

In this case, the allowed actions are:

- Assign to the third variable (the one that's different). This will change it, but the other two remain equal. So as long as the new value of the third variable doesn't make all three distinct, which is possible if the new value is equal to either of the other two.

But this again depends on the values.

Alternatively, the allowed actions when in state B (two variables equal) are:

- Assign to one of the two equal variables: the new value must be equal to the other variable (which is possible if a_i is zero) or to the third variable.

But this is again value-dependent.

Another angle: Since XOR is associative and commutative, perhaps the order in which we assign the a_i's doesn't matter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows:

Each time you choose to assign a_i to either P, Q, or R. The cumulative effect is that each variable is the XOR of the a_i's assigned to it.

At each step, the variables must have at least two equal.

So the problem reduces to counting all possible ways to partition the array a into three subsets (for P, Q, R) such that after each prefix, the cumulative XORs of the subsets up to that point have at least two variables equal.

But how to model this for dynamic programming.

But the constraints are per step, not just the final step. So after each step i, the variables must have at least two equal.

This is a very strict condition, and the number of valid sequences is likely to be small.

But the sample input shows that for some cases, the answer is 3 (all choices are the same variable), but for others, there are more possibilities.

Another observation: If all a_i's are zero, then all sequences are valid. Because each step leaves the variables as all zero (since XORing with zero doesn't change the variable). So the answer is 3^n mod MOD.

But if any a_i is non-zero, then the valid sequences may be limited.

But how?

Let's think about the first non-zero a_i.

Suppose the first non-zero a_i is at position k. Then, the first k-1 steps must have a_i=0, and in each of those steps, you can choose any variable. Then, at step k, you must choose a variable to assign the non-zero a_i, which will transition from state A to state B. Then, in the following steps, you have to manage the transitions.

But this seems too vague.

Another idea: For each position i, after processing a_i, the variables must have at least two equal. So, for the entire sequence to be valid, every prefix must satisfy this.

Let’s consider that when you assign a_i to a variable, you're effectively toggling that variable's value. So the problem is to find all sequences of assignments where after each step, at least two variables have the same value.

But how can this be modeled?

Perhaps the key is to track the current XOR values of P, Q, R. But this is impossible for large n.

But perhaps there's a way to model the problem using the fact that in valid sequences, the assignments are made in a way that ensures that two variables are always assigned the same set of a_i's up to any point.

For example, if we assign all a_i's to P and Q, and none to R. Then, after each step, P and Q are equal, R is zero. So this is allowed.

Similarly, assigning all a_i's to P and R, leaving Q as zero.

Or assigning all a_i's to Q and R, leaving P as zero.

Alternatively, assigning all a_i's to one variable (as in the first sample).

So the valid sequences are those where either:

- All a_i's are assigned to the same variable. (3 options).

- All a_i's are assigned to two variables. (3 choose 2 options, which is 3 options. For each pair (P and Q), (P and R), (Q and R), assign all a_i's to those two variables, and the third is never assigned.

But wait, this would require that after each step, the two assigned variables are equal. Because if they are not, then the third variable (which is zero) may differ from both.

For example, suppose we assign a_1 to P and Q alternately. Then, after step 1, P is a_1, Q is 0, R is 0. This is allowed. Then, step 2: assign a_2 to Q. Now, P is a_1, Q is a_2, R is 0. All three are different if a_1 != a_2 != 0. So this sequence is invalid.

So the only way to assign a_i's to two variables and have the variables be equal after each step is to assign each a_i to both variables in the pair. But this is impossible unless a_i is zero.

Wait, but if a_i is assigned to one of the pair, then the pair's variables will differ. For example, if a_i is assigned to P, then P becomes P^a_i, while Q remains the same. So unless a_i is zero, P and Q will no longer be equal.

So this approach only works if all a_i's are zero. So in that case, any assignment is allowed.

But for other cases, the only valid sequences are those where all a_i's are assigned to the same variable, or to two variables in such a way that after each step, the two variables are equal.

But how?

Suppose we have two variables, say P and Q, and we assign a_i's to them in such a way that their cumulative XORs are always equal. For this to be true, each a_i must be assigned to both P and Q, which is not possible. Or, the assignment must alternate between them in a way that their XORs remain the same. But this seems impossible unless a_i's are zero.

Alternatively, if all a_i's are assigned to both variables, then their XORs would cancel out. For example, if an a_i is assigned to P and then to Q, the net effect is that P's value is a_i and Q's value is a_i. But this requires that each a_i is assigned to both variables, which is not possible in a sequence of choices where each a_i is assigned to exactly one variable.

This suggests that the only valid sequences are those where all a_i's are assigned to the same variable, or some other special cases.

But the second sample input has an output of 9, which is 3^2, suggesting that for two steps, the valid choices are 3^2. But according to the sample note, the valid sequences include PPPP, PPPQ, etc. So in this case, there are more valid sequences than just assigning all to the same variable.

So there must be another pattern.

Another idea: the valid sequences are those where for each step, the choice is made in such a way that the variables P, Q, R have at least two equal. The key is that after each step, two variables are equal.

Thus, for each step i, the choice of variable to XOR must result in two variables being equal.

Let's consider that after step i-1, two variables are equal. For example, P=Q=x, R=y. Then, for step i, we can XOR R (changing y to y^a_i), which leaves P and Q equal. So this is allowed.

Alternatively, XOR P, which changes x to x^a_i. Now, new variables are x^a_i, x, y. We need at least two equal. So either x^a_i == x (a_i=0), which is allowed, or x^a_i == y (which depends on previous values).

But how to track this.

Alternatively, if in the current state two variables are equal (say P=Q=x), then the valid choices for the next step are:

- XOR R. This leaves P and Q equal to x, R becomes y^a_i. So allowed.

- XOR P. Then P becomes x^a_i. Q is x. R is y. For this to be allowed, either x^a_i == x (a_i=0) or x^a_i == y.

- Similarly for XOR Q.

Thus, the number of valid choices in this case depends on whether a_i is zero or whether x^a_i equals y.

But without knowing x and y, this is impossible to track.

So this suggests that the problem can only be solved if the variables x and y are known. But since x and y can be arbitrary values, this approach is not feasible.

Thus, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the valid sequences are those where, for each step i, the assignment is made to a variable that is part of the pair of equal variables from the previous step.

For example:

Initially, all variables are equal. So the first step can be any variable, leading to two variables being equal (the other two).

Then, in the next step, you must assign to one of the two equal variables or the third variable.

Wait, but this is the same as before.

Alternatively, let's think recursively. Each valid sequence must have the following properties:

- After each step, at least two variables are equal.

- The choice of variable to assign at step i must ensure that this condition is maintained.

This seems to require that each choice is made to preserve the condition.

But how?

Perhaps the number of valid sequences can be calculated as follows:

For each step i:

- If a_i is zero: any choice is valid. Because XORing any variable with zero leaves it unchanged. So if the previous state has at least two equal variables, the new state will also have at least two equal variables.

- If a_i is non-zero: the choice must be made such that after XORing, at least two variables are equal.

But how to model this.

Wait, when a_i is non-zero:

If the current state is A (all variables equal to x), then XORing any variable will lead to state B (two variables x, one x^a_i). So 3 choices.

If the current state is B (two variables x, one y), then:

- XORing the third variable (y) will change it to y^a_i. The other two variables are x. So after this, the state is B (two variables x, one y^a_i). So this choice is always allowed.

- XORing one of the two equal variables (x) will change it to x^a_i. The other equal variable remains x. The third variable is y. So the new variables are x^a_i, x, y. For this to be allowed, either x^a_i == x (a_i is zero, but this is not the case) or x^a_i == y.

So if x^a_i == y, then this choice is allowed. Otherwise, it's invalid.

Thus, when in state B and a_i is non-zero, the number of valid choices is 1 (XOR third variable) plus the number of equal variables that when XORed with a_i gives y.

But how to track y.

But y is the third variable in state B. So when we are in state B, y is equal to x ^ s, where s is the cumulative XOR of the variables assigned to the third variable up to this point.

But this is again impossible to track.

So perhaps the only valid sequences are those where all steps are assigned to the same variable, or to the third variable in state B.

For example, if we start in state A, assign to P (leading to state B), then assign all remaining steps to R (third variable) which transitions to state B each time. This would be valid.

So the number of valid sequences would be:

- For each step after the first, you can choose to assign to the third variable (which is allowed) or to one of the two equal variables (if possible).

But without knowing the values of a_i's, this is not possible.

Given the time constraints and the problem's difficulty, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem with two states (A and B) and track the transitions based on whether a_i is zero.

The key insight is that when a_i is zero, the state remains the same. When a_i is non-zero, transitions from state A to B, and from state B to B only if you choose the third variable.

But how to compute this.

Let's try to model the DP as follows:

For each test case, we process the array a.

We maintain two variables: countA (number of valid sequences ending in state A) and countB (number of valid sequences ending in state B).

Initially, countA = 1, countB = 0.

For each a_i in the array:

   if a_i == 0:

       newA = countA * 3 (any choice from A leads to A)

       newB = countB * 3 (any choice from B leads to B)

   else:

       newA = 0 (can't come from A to A with a_i non-zero)

       newB = countA * 3 (each choice from A to B) 

       newB += countB * 1 (choose to assign to third variable)

       Additionally, are there other possibilities?

       For example, if in state B, there are two equal variables x and one y. Assigning to one of the equal variables x would require that x ^ a_i == y.

       But since we can't track x and y, we can't account for these possibilities. Thus, perhaps in this model, these transitions are ignored, leading to an incorrect count.

But according to the sample inputs, this model may not be correct. For example, the second sample input:

4
179 1 1 179

The output is 9. Let's see what the model would predict.

Processing the first a_i=179 (non-zero):

countA = 1, countB =0.

newA =0.

newB = 1*3 =3.

So after first step, countA=0, countB=3.

Second a_i=1 (non-zero):

newB = 0 (countA=0) + countB *1 =3*1=3.

So newB=3.

Third a_i=1 (non-zero):

newB =0 +3*1=3.

Fourth a_i=179 (non-zero):

newB=0+3*1=3.

Total countB=3.

But sample output is 9. So the model is incorrect.

Thus, the model is missing transitions. For example, when in state B and a_i is non-zero, there are more valid choices than just assigning to the third variable.

But how?

The sample's valid sequences include sequences like PPPQ, which implies that after step 4 (assigning to Q), the variables are allowed.

So in this case, after step 3 (assigning to P), variables are 179,0,0. Then, step4 assigns to Q: 0^179=179. Variables are 179,179,0. This is allowed.

In the model, step4 is non-zero. So newB would be countB *1. But countB after step3 is 3. So newB would be 3*1=3. But the sample's answer is 9. So the model is missing transitions where assigning to the equal variables is allowed.

Thus, the model must account for additional transitions when in state B and a_i equals the previous a_i's.

But how?

Another observation: When in state B and a_i is non-zero, the number of valid choices depends on whether a_i equals the XOR of the previous a_i's assigned to the third variable.

But since we can't track that, perhaps there's a pattern when the a_i's are palindromic or have even occurrences.

In the second sample input, the a array is 179, 1, 1, 179. Notice that 179 appears twice, and 1 appears twice. The XOR of the entire array is 179 ^1^1^179 =0.

So perhaps, when the cumulative XOR up to step i is zero, certain transitions are allowed.

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, when the cumulative XOR of a certain subset of a_i's is zero, then XORing those variables leads to state A.

But again, this is unclear.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern or formula that can be derived from the sample inputs.

Looking at the sample outputs:

Sample 1: output 3 =3^1.

Sample 2: output 9=3^2.

Sample 3: output 39 =3*13.

Sample 4: output 123=3*41.

Sample 5: output3=3^1.

So for samples where all a_i are non-zero and the answer is 3, the output is 3^n where n=1, but for sample 2 with n=4 and a certain pattern, the output is 3^2=9.

Sample 2's array has two pairs of equal elements. Perhaps the number of valid sequences is 3^(k), where k is the number of pairs.

But how to determine k.

Alternatively, the number of valid sequences is 3 multiplied by the product of (1 + 2 * count of a_i being zero) for each a_i.

But sample 2 has no zeros. So the product would be (1 + 2 *0) for each non-zero a_i, leading to 1*1*1*1=1. 3*1=3, which does not match the sample.

Alternative idea: When a_i is zero, there are 3 choices for each step, leading to a multiplicative factor of 3. When a_i is non-zero, the number of valid choices depends on the current state.

But sample 2 has no zeros, and the output is 9=3^2. So for 4 steps, perhaps each non-zero a_i contributes a multiplicative factor of 3/3=1, except for two steps.

This is not helpful.

Another approach: Let's think about the problem as a tree of possible choices. Each node represents the state (A or B), and each edge represents a choice.

For each step, the number of valid sequences is the sum of the valid transitions from the previous state.

But to model this correctly, we need to account for all possible transitions.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the correct way to model the problem is to use the following dynamic programming approach:

We track two variables:

- A: the number of sequences where all variables are equal.

- B: the number of sequences where exactly two variables are equal.

For each a_i:

If a_i is zero:

   newA = A *3 + B *0 (since any choice from A keeps it in A, and choices from B keep it in B. But wait, no. If a_i is zero:

- From state A: any choice (3) leaves the variables in A.

- From state B: any choice (3) leaves the variables in B.

So newA = A *3.

 newB = B *3.

But this is not correct because when in state B, choosing to assign to one of the equal variables would leave them equal. For example, variables are x, x, y. Assign to x with a_i=0: variables remain x, x, y. So state B.

Thus, for a_i=0:

 newA = A *3 (all transitions from A to A).

 newB = B *3 (all transitions from B to B).

If a_i is not zero:

 newA = B * 2 * 1 (if in state B, there are two choices to assign to one of the two equal variables, and if this results in all variables being equal).

But this is unclear.

Alternatively:

When in state B (variables are x, x, y) and a_i is non-zero:

- Assign to the third variable (y): new variables are x, x, y^a_i. This is allowed (state B). So this gives 1 choice.

- Assign to one of the equal variables (x): new variables are x^a_i, x, y. This is allowed only if x^a_i == y. So if x^a_i == y, this is allowed. The number of such choices is 2 (since there are two equal variables).

But since we can't track x and y, we can't compute this.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the correct solution is to model the problem with two states, and for each non-zero a_i, the transitions are:

newA = B * 2 (if possible)

newB = A * 3 + B *1

But how to arrive at this.

Looking at sample 2:

After the first a_i=179 (non-zero):

A=0, B=3.

Second a_i=1 (non-zero):

A would be B * 2 (if possible). B would be 0*3 + B *1 =3*1=3. So newB=3. But sample's answer after two steps would have 3 *3=9.

This suggests that perhaps for non-zero a_i:

newA = B * 2 if some condition is met.

newB = A *3 + B * 1.

But why would newA be B *2?

Perhaps when in state B and a_i is non-zero, there are two choices that transition to state A.

For example, if assigning to one of the two equal variables results in x^a_i == y, then the new variables are (x^a_i, x, y) → if x^a_i == y, then variables are y, x, y → two equal variables (first and third). So state B, but wait, x and y are such that x^a_i = y. So if x^a_i == y, then y^a_i ==x. So perhaps this forms a loop.

But this is getting too complicated.

An alternative approach inspired by the sample inputs and the need for an efficient solution:

The number of valid ways is equal to 3 multiplied by the product for each i>1 of (1 if a_i is non-zero and a_1^a_2^...^a_i is zero, else 0), but this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, the valid sequences are those where the XOR of all a_i's assigned to P, Q, and R are such that after each step, at least two are equal. But how.

Given the time constraints, I think the correct approach is to model the problem with two states: A and B.

For each step i:

- If a_i is zero:

   newA = A *3

   newB = B *3

- If a_i is non-zero:

   newA = B * 2 (assuming that there are two ways to transition from B to A)

   newB = A *3 + B * 1

This model would explain sample 2.

Let's see:

Sample 2:

n=4, a = [179,1,1,179]

Step 1: a_i=179, non-zero.

newA = B *2 (but B is initially 0) → 0.

newB = A *3 + B *1 → 1*3 +0=3.

So after step 1: A=0, B=3.

Step 2: a_i=1, non-zero.

newA = B*2 →3*2=6.

newB = A*3 + B*1 →0 +3*1=3.

So now, A=6, B=3.

Step 3: a_i=1, non-zero.

newA = B*2 →3*2=6.

newB = A*3 + B*1 →6*3 +3*1=18+3=21.

Now, A=6, B=21.

Step4: a_i=179, non-zero.

newA = B*2 →21*2=42.

newB = A*3 + B*1 →6*3 +21*1=18+21=39.

Total ways: A + B =42 +39=81. But sample output is 9. So this model is incorrect.

Thus, this approach is not correct.

Given that I'm unable to find the correct model, I'll refer to the solution approach.

The correct approach, according to the problem's intended solution, is as follows:

The key observation is that after each step, the three variables P, Q, R must not be all pairwise distinct. This can be satisfied in two scenarios:

1. All three are equal.

2. Exactly two are equal.

The transitions between these states can be modeled with dynamic programming, where each state depends on the previous state and the current a_i.

For each a_i, if it is zero:

- XORing any variable leaves the state as before. So from state A, three ways to stay in A. From state B, three ways to stay in B.

If a_i is non-zero:

- From state A: XORing any variable leads to state B (three ways).

- From state B: there are two possibilities:

   a. XOR the third variable (the one that's different), which leaves two variables equal (the other two), so state B (1 way).

   b. XOR one of the two equal variables. This is allowed only if a_i is equal to the difference between the two variables in state B. However, since we don't track the actual values, this is not possible. But it turns out that the number of valid ways in this case is 2 if the current a_i is the same as the a_i that caused the transition into state B.

But how?

The correct model is to track two states:

- State A: all variables equal.

- State B: exactly two variables equal, and the third is equal to their XOR with some s.

The key is to realize that when in state B, the third variable is the XOR of s, which is the cumulative XOR of all a_i's processed in the current "B" phase.

Thus, for each a_i in state B:

- XORing the third variable adds a_i to s.

- XORing one of the two equal variables is allowed only if a_i == s, which would merge the variables back into state A.

Thus, the transitions are:

When a_i is non-zero:

From state B:

   - XORing the third variable: leads to state B with s' = s ^ a_i.

   - XORing one of the two equal variables: allowed only if a_i == s. If so, leads to state A.

Thus, the number of valid ways from state B is:

   1 (for XORing the third variable) + 2 * (if a_i == s) ? 1 : 0).

But how to track s.

Thus, the state for state B must track the current s value.

But this is possible by considering that when you transition from state A to B, s is the a_i that caused the transition. Then, each subsequent a_i in state B updates s by XORing with a_i if you choose to assign to the third variable.

Thus, the model must track:

- State A: count.

- State B: a dictionary of possible s values and their counts.

But for large n and large s values, this is impractical.

But the problem constraints allow a_i to be up to 1e9 and n up to 2e5. Thus, the number of distinct s values can be up to 2e5, but this is manageable.

Thus, the dynamic programming approach is as follows:

- dpA: the number of ways to reach state A.

- dpB: a dictionary where keys are the possible s values, and the values are the number of ways to reach state B with that s.

Initially, dpA = 1, dpB is empty.

For each a_i:

   if a_i is zero:

      new_dpA = dpA * 3 + sum(dpB.values()) * 3

      new_dpB is empty.

   else:

      # From state A:

      new_dpB_entry = dpA * 3

      # From state B:

      new_dpB_entries are created by XORing each s in dpB with a_i, and incrementing their counts.

      # Also, from state B, if you choose to assign to the two equal variables:

      # For each s in dpB, if a_i == s, then you can transition to state A with 2 * count.

      new_dpA = sum (2 * count for s, count in dpB.items() if s == a_i)

      new_dpB = defaultdict(int)

      # For each s in dpB, XOR with a_i and add to new_dpB.

      for s in dpB:

          new_s = s ^ a_i

          new_dpB[new_s] += dpB[s]

      # Add the new entries from state A to new_dpB.

      new_dpB[a_i] += new_dpB_entry

      # Update new_dpA and new_dpB.

Thus, the transitions are:

For a_i = 0:

   All sequences from state A stay in A, and all sequences from state B stay in B. But since a_i is zero, the third variable (s) doesn't change.

Wait, no. If a_i is zero and you are in state B, then XORing the third variable (s) with a_i (zero) leaves s unchanged. So the new s is s ^0 = s. So the entries in dpB remain the same.

But the model for a_i=0 is:

new_dpA = dpA *3 (from state A, 3 choices leading to state A).

new_dpB = dpB multiplied by 3 (each entry in dpB can be reached by 3 choices, but since a_i is zero, XORing any variable leaves the s value unchanged. Thus, each entry in dpB is multiplied by 3.

But the correct way is:

For a_i=0:

   new_dpA = dpA *3 (from state A).

   new_dpB remains the same s values, but each entry's count is multiplied by 3 (since there are 3 choices leading to state B with the same s).

Thus, the code would be:

if a_i == 0:

    new_dpA = (dpA * 3) % MOD

    new_dpB = {s: (count *3) % MOD for s, count in dpB.items()}

else:

    new_dpA = 0

    # Contributions from state B where a_i == s.

    new_dpA = sum( (count * 2) % MOD for s, count in dpB.items() if s == a_i )

    # Contributions from state A: transitions to B with s = a_i.

    new_dpB = defaultdict(int)

    # Add the transitions from state A.

    new_dpB[a_i] = (new_dpB.get(a_i, 0) + dpA *3) % MOD

    # Add the transitions from state B by XORing the third variable.

    for s, count in dpB.items():

        new_s = s ^ a_i

        new_dpB[new_s] = (new_dpB.get(new_s, 0) + count) % MOD

    # Also, the transitions from state B where a_i == s are already considered in new_dpA.

    # The counts for those s are already multiplied by 2 and added to new_dpA.

Thus, the final answer is the sum of new_dpA and the sum of new_dpB's values after processing all a_i's.

This model correctly accounts for transitions from state B where a_i equals s, allowing transition to state A with 2 choices (since there are two equal variables to choose from).

Testing this model with sample 2:

Sample 2:

n=4, a=[179,1,1,179]

Initial state: dpA=1, dpB=empty.

Step 1: a_i=179, non-zero.

new_dpA is sum of 2 * count where s == 179. dpB is empty, so new_dpA=0.

new_dpB is:

   transitions from state A: add 3*1=3 to s=179.

   transitions from state B: none.

So new_dpB = {179:3}.

dpA=0, dpB={179:3}.

Step 2: a_i=1, non-zero.

new_dpA is sum of 2*count where s==1. dpB has s=179, not 1. So new_dpA=0.

new_dpB:

   transitions from state A: 0 (dpA is 0).

   transitions from state B: XOR 179 ^1 = 178. So new_dpB[178] = 3.

   add transitions from state B.

So new_dpB = {178:3}.

dpA=0, dpB={178:3}.

Step3: a_i=1, non-zero.

new_dpA is sum of 2*count where s==1. dpB has s=178, not 1. So new_dpA=0.

new_dpB:

   transitions from state A: 0.

   transitions from state B: 178 ^1=179. So new_dpB[179] =3.

So new_dpB={179:3}.

dpA=0, dpB={179:3}.

Step4: a_i=179, non-zero.

new_dpA is sum of 2*count where s==179. dpB has s=179, count=3. So new_dpA = 3*2=6.

new_dpB:

   transitions from state A: 0.

   transitions from state B: 179 ^179=0. So new_dpB[0] =3.

But new_dpA is 6, and new_dpB is {0:3}.

Final answer is 6 + 3=9, which matches the sample.

This model works.

Thus, the solution is to track dpA and dpB as a dictionary of s values, and for each a_i, compute new_dpA and new_dpB according to the transitions described.

Thus, the code will:

For each test case:

Initialize dpA =1, dpB as empty.

For each a_i in array:

   if a_i ==0:

       new_dpA = (dpA *3) % MOD

       new_dpB = {s: (count *3) % MOD for s, count in dpB.items()}

   else:

       new_dpA = sum( (count *2) % MOD for s, count in dpB.items() if s ==a_i )

       new_dpB = defaultdict(int)

       # Add transitions from state A to B.

       new_dpB[a_i] = (new_dpB[a_i] + dpA *3) % MOD

       # Add transitions from state B to B (XOR third variable).

       for s, count in dpB.items():

           new_s = s ^ a_i

           new_dpB[new_s] = (new_dpB[new_s] + count) % MOD

   dpA, dpB = new_dpA, new_dpB

The answer is (dpA + sum(dpB.values())) % MOD.

But since dpB can be large, we need to optimize the sum for new_dpA. For each a_i, we check if a_i is present in dpB and sum those counts multiplied by 2.

Implementing this in Python using a default dictionary or a regular dictionary.

Now, considering that for large n and large t, we need to handle this efficiently.

Now, let's test this code on the first sample:

Sample 1:

n=3, a=[1,7,9]

Step1: a_i=1, non-zero.

new_dpA = 0 (dpB is empty).

new_dpB = {1:3} (from state A).

dpA=0, dpB={1:3}.

Step2: a_i=7.

new_dpA: sum 2*count where s==7. dpB has s=1. So new_dpA=0.

new_dpB:

   from state A: 0.

   from state B: s=1 XOR 7=6. So new_dpB={6:3}.

Step3: a_i=9.

new_dpA: sum 2*count where s==9. dpB has s=6. new_dpA=0.

new_dpB:

   from state A: 0.

   from state B:6^9=15. new_dpB={15:3}.

Final answer is 0 (dpA) +3 (sum of dpB) =3. Which matches the sample.

Sample 5: n=1, a_i=1e9.

Step1: a_i=1e9 !=0.

new_dpA: 0.

new_dpB={1e9:3}.

sum is 3. Which matches the sample.

Thus, this model works.

Thus, the code should be implemented as described.
