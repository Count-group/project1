Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about transforming array a into array b using certain operations. The operation allows us to select a subarray of a that has the maximum sum among all possible non-empty subarrays and replace it with another non-empty array. We need to check if it's possible and if so, construct the sequence of operations.

First, I need to understand the operation properly. So, each time we perform an operation, we look at all non-empty subarrays of the current a, compute their sums, find the maximum sum among them, then choose any subarray that has this maximum sum and replace it with any non-empty array. The key here is that we can choose any of the maximum-sum subarrays each time.

The goal is to turn a into b. How to approach this?

Let me think about the possible cases. If a and b are already the same, then zero operations are needed. Otherwise, we need to find a sequence of replacements.

But how can replacing maximum-sum subarrays lead us from a to b?

Wait, when we replace a subarray with another array, the new elements can change the possible maximum subarrays in the next steps. So the strategy might involve breaking down the problem into steps where each step simplifies the array towards b.

But how to model this?

Let me think about the maximum subarray sum. Suppose the maximum sum in the current array is S. Then in each operation, we can choose any subarray with sum S and replace it with another array. The replacement array can be anything, but it's non-empty. So replacing a maximum subarray might help reduce the maximum sum in subsequent steps.

Wait, but replacing a maximum subarray with a new array could potentially lower the maximum subarray sum. For example, if the original array has a maximum sum subarray of S, and we replace it with a subarray whose elements sum to something less than S. Then the next maximum sum would be the next highest possible subarray sum in the array.

Alternatively, if the new array's sum is higher than S, then the maximum could increase, but that's probably not helpful for getting to b. Because in the end, b must be achievable through such steps.

But the problem allows us to replace with any array. So maybe the approach is to break down the problem into steps where each step replaces a part of a to match the corresponding part in b, but ensuring that the replaced subarray is a maximum sum subarray.

But how to align the structure of a and b so that these operations can be applied?

Alternatively, perhaps the process can be reversed. Instead of transforming a into b, think about transforming b into a by performing inverse operations, which might be easier to model. But I'm not sure what the inverse operation would be here.

Alternatively, think about the elements of b as being formed by splitting and merging parts of a through these operations. Each operation can replace a contiguous segment (a subarray) with another array, but only if that segment was a maximum sum subarray at the time.

Hmm. Another idea: since each replacement can only affect a contiguous subarray, perhaps the elements of b can be formed by inserting or replacing parts of a. But the constraint is that each replacement must be a maximum sum subarray.

Wait, but the replacement can be done with any array. So maybe the approach is to find a way to split a into parts that can be replaced step by step to build b.

Alternatively, consider the maximum sum of the entire array. Suppose the entire array is the maximum sum subarray. Then we can replace the entire array with any array, which could be b. But that's only possible if the maximum sum of the initial array is the sum of the entire array. Otherwise, this approach wouldn't work.

Wait, let's take the first example from the demo input:

Original a is [2, -3, 2, 0]. The maximum subarray sum here is 3 (the subarray [2, -3, 2, 0] sum is 1? Wait no, maybe I miscalculated. Let me compute the maximum subarray sum for the initial a.

The initial array is [2, -3, 2, 0]. Let's compute all possible subarrays:

Possible subarrays:

[2] → sum 2

[2, -3] → sum -1

[2, -3, 2] → sum 1

[2, -3, 2, 0] → sum 1

[-3] → -3

[-3, 2] → -1

[-3, 2, 0] → -1

[2] → 2

[2,0] → 2

[0] → 0

Wait, the maximum sum here is 2. But wait, the subarrays [2] (first element) and [2,0] (sum 2) both have sum 2. So the maximum sum is 2. But in the first step of the demo output, they replaced positions 3-4 (elements [2,0]) with -3. So that's a subarray of sum 2, which was a maximum sum subarray.

So the first operation replaces a subarray of maximum sum (sum 2) with a single element -3, leading to a new array [2, -3, -3].

Then the next operation replaces the first element (sum 2) with -3, leading to [-3, -3, -3]. Then the next step replaces the second element (sum -3) with -7 (but how? Because the maximum sum subarray would be -3 here?), wait this part is confusing.

Wait perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let's look at the demo explanation:

After first operation, the array becomes [2, -3, -3]. Then in the next operation, they replace the first element (sum 2) with -3. But how is the first element a maximum sum subarray? Because the array is [2, -3, -3]. The possible subarrays are [2] (sum 2), [2, -3] (sum -1), [2, -3, -3] (sum -4), [-3] (-3), [-3,-3] (-6), [-3] (-3). So the maximum sum is 2, so the first element is a maximum sum subarray. So replacing it with -3 gives [-3, -3, -3]. Then, in the next step, the maximum sum is -3 (all elements are -3, so any single element is a max sum subarray). So they replace the second element (sum -3) with -7. The array becomes [-3, -7, -3]. Then the next step, the third element is sum 0? Wait no, the target array in the demo output is [-3, -7, 0]. So perhaps in the last step, they replace the third element (sum -3) with 0, which would make the array [-3, -7, 0].

But wait, in the array [-3, -7, -3], the maximum sum subarray would be any single element. So the third element is -3. So replacing it with 0 is allowed.

So each step is replacing a single element (since that's the maximum sum subarray) with the desired element.

So the key here is that once all elements are negative, each individual element is a maximum sum subarray (since their sum is the maximum possible, which is the maximum element in the array). So when the array consists of all negative elements, each element can be replaced individually.

So the strategy could be:

1. Find all the positions where a's elements differ from b's elements. Then, for each such position, replace that element (assuming it's part of a maximum sum subarray).

But how to ensure that each such element can be replaced? Because in the initial steps, the maximum sum could be higher, but after certain replacements, the maximum sum can be lowered, allowing more elements to be replaced.

Hmm. So perhaps the approach is to first process the parts of the array that have the highest maximum sum. For example, in the initial array, the maximum sum is 2. So we can replace that subarray (like the first element, or the third element, etc.) with a new array. But replacing that with a subarray that has a lower sum would help in reducing the maximum sum in subsequent steps.

So maybe the plan is:

- Find the maximum sum subarray in the current a. Replace it with a part that corresponds to the target array in b. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the target array can be constructed by a series of replacements that start from the end. For example, if the last element in b is different from the last element in a, then in the final steps, replace the last element (assuming that at that point, the maximum sum subarrays are individual elements). But how to get to that state.

Another approach: to make the array a into an array where each element is part of a maximum sum subarray. For example, when all elements are negative, each element is a maximum sum subarray (since each element is a possible candidate). So once we have all elements negative (or non-positive?), we can replace each element one by one.

But how to reach that state.

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the maximum possible sum. Each operation replaces a subarray of sum S (the current maximum) with a new array. The new array's sum can be anything. So if we want to reduce the maximum sum, we can replace a subarray of sum S with a subarray that has a smaller sum. Then in subsequent steps, the new maximum sum would be the next highest possible sum in the array.

So perhaps the process is to iteratively reduce the maximum sum until it's possible to manipulate individual elements.

Wait, in the first example:

Initial a has a maximum sum of 2. Replace that subarray (like the first element) with -3. Now the array is [-3, -3, 2, 0]. Then the maximum sum is 2 again (the subarray [2, 0] sum 2). So replace that with -3. Now array is [-3, -3, -3]. Now maximum sum is -3. Each element is a max sum subarray. So then replace the second element with -7 (sum -3). Then replace the third element with 0 (sum -3).

But how to structure this in code.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps can be broken down into:

1. If the sum of the entire array is the maximum possible, then we can replace the entire array with a single element (if needed). But in the case where the maximum sum is higher than the sum of the entire array, then the entire array can't be replaced unless it's part of a maximum sum subarray.

This is getting complicated.

An alternative idea: the problem allows any sequence of operations, as long as each step replaces a maximum sum subarray. So perhaps the key is to first make the array such that all elements are part of the same maximum sum subarray. Then, replace that entire subarray with the target array. But that's possible only if the sum of the entire array is the maximum possible.

Wait, but in the first example, the sum of the entire array is 2 + (-3) + 2 + 0 = 1. But the maximum sum subarray is 2 (the first element). So replacing the entire array is not an option.

Hmm. So that approach won't work.

Another angle: perhaps the target array can be built by inserting elements into a. But since each replacement can split the array into parts, perhaps we can model this as a process where each replacement step breaks the array into parts that can be adjusted independently.

Alternatively, perhaps the process can be viewed as building the target array from right to left, left to right, or in some order.

Wait, in the first example, the final array is [-3, -7, 0]. The original array after replacements is transformed step by step. Let's see:

Initial steps:

After first operation: [2, -3, -3] (replaced the last two elements 2 and 0 with -3). Then next step replaces the first element (sum 2) with -3, leading to [-3, -3, -3]. Then replace the second element (sum -3) with -7. Now array is [-3, -7, -3]. Then replace the third element with 0. So the steps are building parts of the target array by replacing individual elements once the array is all negatives.

So perhaps the plan is:

1. Make all elements in a negative (or non-positive) so that each element is a maximum sum subarray. Then, each element can be replaced individually.

But how to reach that state.

So perhaps the steps are:

a. Find the maximum sum subarray in the current array.

b. Replace it with a subarray that has a sum lower than the current maximum sum. This would reduce the maximum sum of the array.

c. Repeat until the maximum sum is as low as possible (all elements are non-positive), allowing individual element replacements.

Once all elements are non-positive, each element is a maximum sum subarray. Then, replace each element that doesn't match b's elements with the desired value.

But how to ensure that this is possible.

Wait, but the target array may have elements with higher sums than the original a. For example, if the target array has a positive element. But in that case, how to insert it.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because once the array is in a state where all elements are negative, replacing individual elements (each of which is a maximum sum subarray) can only replace them with other elements. If the target array has positive elements, then after replacement, the new elements would have higher sums. But then those elements would form a maximum sum subarray, which can be replaced again.

But perhaps this is possible. Let's think of a case where the target array has a positive element.

For example, if a is [5], and b is [10]. Then the initial array's maximum sum is 5, so replace it with [10]. Then the array becomes [10], which is the desired array. So this works.

So even if the target array has higher sum elements, it's possible as long as each step is allowed.

So the strategy could be:

1. For each test case, check if the multiset of elements in b can be formed through a series of replacements of maximum sum subarrays.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:

- First, check if the elements of b can be formed by merging some elements of a through replacements. But this is vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the sum of all elements in a must be at least the sum of the maximum elements in b. Wait, no. Because in the first example, the sum of a is 1, and the sum of b is -10. So that's not the case.

Another idea: the problem allows us to replace any maximum sum subarray with any array. So perhaps the order in which we replace the subarrays is flexible. For example, if the maximum sum is S, we can choose any of the subarrays with sum S and replace them. So the approach could be to greedily replace the rightmost or leftmost maximum sum subarray in each step.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, consider that each replacement can modify the array in a way that allows us to split the problem into smaller subproblems.

For example, if after replacing a subarray, the array is split into parts that can be processed independently because their maximum sums are lower than the current maximum.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think of another approach. Let's consider that in each operation, the replaced subarray is of maximum sum. So the steps must be such that each replacement is a maximum sum subarray at that step.

The problem requires us to find a sequence of operations that transforms a into b, and the sum of the lengths of the replacement arrays across all operations must not exceed n + m.

So the solution must not be too complicated. Perhaps there's a way to model this as a greedy process where we first process the elements of b in some order, replacing parts of a step by step.

Wait, perhaps the key is to note that if the sum of all elements in the array is the maximum sum, then we can replace the entire array with the target array in one step. Otherwise, we need to break down the array into parts.

But how to check if the entire array's sum is the maximum possible.

For example, if the maximum sum of any subarray is equal to the sum of the entire array, then the entire array can be replaced. Otherwise, replacing the entire array is not allowed.

So, first, compute the maximum subarray sum of a. If this is equal to the sum of the entire array, then the entire array can be replaced in one step. Then, the problem reduces to whether the target array can be formed with this operation.

But the target array's sum doesn't need to be anything specific, since the replacement can be arbitrary. For example, even if the sum is higher than the original maximum, the replacement is allowed.

So, for example, if the maximum subarray sum is S, and the entire array's sum is S, then in one step we can replace the entire array with the target array. So this is possible only if S is the maximum subarray sum of the current array.

So in this case, the answer is to perform a single operation replacing the entire array with b.

But if the entire array's sum is not the maximum subarray sum (i.e., there exists a subarray with a higher sum), then this approach won't work.

But how to check if the maximum subarray sum is equal to the sum of the entire array. That's equivalent to the array being such that all possible prefix sums and suffix sums are non-negative. Or perhaps not. For example, if the array is [1, -2, 3], the sum is 2. The maximum subarray sum is 3 (the last element). So the sum of the entire array is less than the maximum subarray sum.

So, in this case, the entire array's sum is not the maximum subarray sum.

So, how to determine if the entire array's sum is the maximum subarray sum.

This can be checked using Kadane's algorithm. Let's compute the maximum subarray sum. Then compare it with the sum of the entire array. If they are equal, then the entire array can be replaced.

So, in such a case, replacing the entire array with b is possible. But only if the maximum subarray sum of the current array is equal to the sum of the entire array.

So, for example, if a is [3, -1, 2], the sum is 4. The maximum subarray sum is 4 (the entire array). So replacing it with b is possible.

But if the maximum subarray sum is higher than the sum of the entire array, then replacing the entire array is not allowed.

So, the initial approach could be:

If the maximum subarray sum of a is equal to the sum of the entire array, then replace the entire array with b. But this only works if after this replacement, the sum of the new array's maximum subarray is not higher than the sum of b's entire array, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Because after replacing the entire array with b, the maximum subarray sum of the new array is whatever the maximum subarray sum of b is. But the next operations would depend on that. However, in the problem, we need to perform operations until the array becomes exactly equal to b. So, if after replacing the entire array with b, the array is exactly b, then the process is done. So the condition is whether the initial array's maximum subarray sum equals its entire array's sum, and the entire array can be replaced with b in one step. Then, this is possible only if in the initial array, the maximum subarray sum is equal to the sum of the entire array.

So, first check if a can be replaced entirely with b in one step. If yes, then that's the solution.

Otherwise, proceed to find another approach.

But in most cases, this won't be possible. For example, in the first demo input, the sum of a is 1, but the maximum subarray sum is 2 (the first element). So the entire array can't be replaced.

So, the next idea is to decompose the array into parts where each part can be replaced step by step.

But how?

Another approach is to note that the problem allows the replacement of any maximum sum subarray with any array, including arrays that have elements that are part of the target. So, perhaps the process can be divided into steps where each step replaces a part of the array that is not matching the target with the desired part.

But the replacement can only be done on a maximum sum subarray. So, the key is to find a way to replace the non-matching parts by ensuring that they are part of a maximum sum subarray at some step.

Alternatively, perhaps we can first convert the array into a state where all elements are part of a maximum sum subarray (like all elements being negative), then replace the elements one by one.

So, steps:

1. Convert the array into all negative elements. Then, each element is a maximum sum subarray. Replace each element that doesn't match the target.

But how to convert the array into all negatives. Let's see.

For example, in the initial a array, if there are positive elements, their subarrays may have higher sums. So, the process is to replace maximum sum subarrays with arrays that have lower sums, thus reducing the maximum sum.

For instance, if the current maximum sum is S, we can replace the subarray with sum S with an array that has a sum less than S. Then, in the next steps, the maximum sum will be the next highest sum.

This way, we can iteratively reduce the maximum sum until all elements are negative.

Once all elements are negative, each element is a maximum sum subarray (since each element is the maximum possible sum in its subarrays). Then, we can replace each element that doesn't match the target array with the desired element.

But how to make sure that the target array can be formed this way.

So, the algorithm could be:

a) Check if the target array b can be split into parts that can be constructed by replacing individual elements once the array is all negatives.

But this is possible only if the target array's elements can be inserted via replacing individual elements. For example, if after making the array all negative, we can replace each element with the corresponding element in b. However, if any element in b is positive, this requires that after replacement, those elements are part of a maximum sum subarray in subsequent steps.

But in that case, after replacing some elements with positive values, the maximum sum would be those elements. So replacing them would not be possible unless they are part of a maximum sum subarray again.

Hmm, this complicates things. For example, suppose we have the array all negatives, then we replace one element with a positive value. Now, the maximum sum subarray is that positive element. So, the next operation can replace it with another element, but only if that's part of a maximum sum subarray.

But if the target array has multiple positive elements, this approach might not work.

So perhaps this approach is only feasible if the target array can be constructed with elements that are all non-positive. Because then, once the array is all non-positive, we can replace elements one by one.

But the problem's sample input 3 seems to have elements in b that are positive. Wait, looking at the demo input for test case 3:

Original a: [-5, 9, -3, 5, -9]

Original b: [-6, 6, -1, -9]

Wait, the target array has 6 and -1, which are positive. So in this case, the approach of making the array all negative and then replacing elements won't work, since replacing elements with positive values would create maximum sum subarrays that are those elements.

So, perhaps the approach needs to be more flexible.

Alternative idea: For the target array b, perhaps the elements can be grouped into contiguous segments that can be formed by replacing maximum sum subarrays in previous steps.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, think recursively. Suppose we want to transform a into b. We can look for a contiguous segment in b that matches some part of a. Then, see if the rest can be formed by replacing other parts. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since each operation allows replacing a maximum sum subarray with any array, perhaps the target array can be built by inserting new elements in a way that each insertion is part of a maximum sum subarray.

But again, this is vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by comparing the elements of a and b in reverse order. For example, if the last element of a and b are the same, we can leave them and work on the previous elements. If they are different, we need to replace the corresponding subarray in a to match the elements in b.

But how to ensure that the replaced subarray is a maximum sum subarray.

Wait, perhaps the solution involves greedily replacing the rightmost possible maximum subarray each time. Let's think with the first sample input.

Original a: [2, -3, 2, 0]

Target b: [-3, -7, 0]

The steps in the demo replace parts from right to left. Let's see:

Step 1: Replace subarray 3-4 (elements 2 and 0) with -3. So the array becomes [2, -3, -3]. The sum of 2+(-3) + (-3) = -4. The maximum subarray sum is 2 (first element). Then, replace that with -3. Now array is [-3, -3, -3]. Maximum sum is -3. Then replace second element with -7, then third with 0.

So the strategy here is to replace the rightmost possible maximum subarrays first, converting the array into all negatives, then replace elements one by one.

So perhaps the approach is:

1. For the target array, process the elements from the end towards the beginning. For each position in b, if the corresponding element in the current a is different, replace it by replacing a subarray that ends at that position (assuming it's part of a maximum sum subarray). But how to ensure that.

Alternatively, the following algorithm:

- Make the entire array into a single element by repeatedly replacing maximum subarrays with smaller ones. But this seems unclear.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

Check if the sum of the entire array is the maximum subarray sum. If so, replace it with the target array. Otherwise, find the first occurrence in a where the elements start to differ from b, and find a way to replace that part.

But this is not straightforward.

Another angle: the problem requires that after all operations, a becomes b. So, the sum of all elements of a, after replacements, must equal the sum of b. However, each replacement changes the sum of the array. For example, replacing a subarray with sum S with a new array of sum T changes the total sum by T - S.

But the problem allows any replacements, so the sum can be adjusted in any way. So the sum of the original a and the sum of b can be anything, as long as the steps are possible.

So sum is not a constraint. So the sum of the original a and target b can differ. Hence, the sum of the arrays is not a factor in determining possibility.

Therefore, the problem is not dependent on the sum of a and b.

So the problem is not about sums, but about the sequence of elements and whether they can be matched through replacements of maximum sum subarrays.

But how to model this.

Let's think about the structure of the target array.

Suppose the target array is b. We need to find a way to insert the elements of b into a through replacements.

Each replacement is a contiguous subarray. So perhaps the target array can be built by replacing parts of a with the corresponding parts of b, provided that those parts are maximum sum subarrays at the time.

But how to ensure that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by first converting a into an array where all elements are the same as the first element of b, then the second, and so on. But this would require replacing parts of a in a way that allows each element to be adjusted.

Alternatively, think of the problem as a two-step process:

1. Convert the original array into an array where each element is part of a maximum sum subarray. For example, make all elements negative.

2. Replace each individual element to match the target array.

But step 1 may not always be possible. For example, if the original array has a maximum sum subarray that cannot be replaced in a way that reduces the maximum sum.

But in the first sample input, after replacing the first element with -3, the array becomes [-3, -3, 2, 0]. The maximum sum is now 2 (the subarray [2,0] or [2]). So replacing that with -3 again would make the array [-3, -3, -3, -3]. Then, each element is a maximum sum subarray.

But this requires multiple steps.

So, the general approach could be:

- In each step, replace a maximum sum subarray with a subarray that has a sum lower than the current maximum. This reduces the maximum sum in the next steps.

- Repeat until the maximum sum is such that all elements are individual maximum sum subarrays (i.e., all elements are equal to the maximum sum, which is the case when all elements are the same and are the maximum possible).

Wait, but if all elements are the same and negative, then each individual element is a maximum sum subarray.

So, once the array is filled with a single value (say, all -k, where k is positive), then each element is a maximum sum subarray, and can be replaced individually.

Thus, the steps could be:

1. Replace the entire array with a single element (assuming the entire array is a maximum sum subarray). But this is only possible if the sum of the entire array is the maximum subarray sum.

But if it's not, then we need to proceed step by step.

Alternatively, in each step, replace the maximum sum subarray with an array of a single element, which is chosen to be less than the current maximum sum. This way, the maximum sum decreases each time.

For example:

Original array has maximum sum S. Replace that subarray with a single element S-1. Then, the new array's maximum sum is S-1.

Repeat this until the maximum sum is such that all elements are individual maximum sum subarrays.

But how to do this.

Alternatively, for each maximum sum subarray, replace it with a single element that is the sum of the target elements. But this doesn't directly help.

Hmm.

Perhaps the key is to realize that once the array consists of a single element, then that element is the maximum sum subarray, and can be replaced with any array. So perhaps the steps could be:

- Replace the array into a single element, then replace that element with the target array.

But this is possible only if the entire array is a maximum sum subarray. If not, then we can't replace it in one step.

But how to make the entire array a maximum sum subarray.

Alternatively, we can repeatedly replace maximum sum subarrays to merge them into larger subarrays until the entire array is a maximum sum subarray.

But this seems not straightforward.

Another idea: the problem allows us to replace any maximum sum subarray with any non-empty array. So, in the first step, if we can replace a maximum sum subarray with an array that has a sum higher than the current maximum, then the next step's maximum sum would be higher. But this seems counterintuitive, as it would complicate the process.

But the problem allows this. For example, if the initial array is [3], and we replace it with [5], then the next step's maximum sum is 5.

But this is allowed, but it's not clear how to leverage this.

But since the problem allows us to choose any replacement array, perhaps we can use this to our advantage. For example, replace a maximum sum subarray with an array that has the same sum as the current maximum. This way, the maximum sum remains the same, but the array can be restructured.

But again, I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps I should look for an algorithmic approach that can be implemented, given the problem's constraints.

The key insight seems to be that once all elements are negative, each element is a maximum sum subarray, and can be replaced individually. So, the plan is:

1. Convert the array into all negatives, regardless of the target.

2. Replace each element that differs from the target.

But how to convert the array into all negatives.

To convert the array into all negatives, we need to replace all positive elements. Each time a positive element is part of a maximum sum subarray, we can replace it with a negative value. Repeating this until all elements are negative.

But the process to do this may involve multiple steps.

For example, suppose the array has elements [2, -3, 2, 0]. The positive elements are 2 and 2, 0.

The maximum sum subarray is the first element (sum 2). Replace it with -3. Now array is [-3, -3, 2, 0]. The maximum sum is now 2 (the third element). Replace it with -3. Now array is [-3, -3, -3, 0]. The maximum sum is 0 (the fourth element). Replace it with -3. Now array is all negatives. Then replace elements as needed.

But this seems possible.

So the algorithm could be:

While there exists a positive element in the array:

   Find a maximum sum subarray (which must have a positive sum).

   Replace it with a single negative element (e.g., -1).

Once all elements are negative, replace individual elements to match the target.

But how to handle cases where the target array has positive elements.

Ah, but after making all elements negative, the next steps can replace individual elements (each is a maximum sum subarray) with the desired elements (positive or not). For example, if the target array has a positive element in position i, then we can replace the i-th element (current value negative) with the desired positive value. However, after replacement, this element will have a positive value, which is the maximum sum subarray. So, any subsequent operation can replace this element again if needed.

But wait, in the steps after making all elements negative, we can replace each element with the corresponding target element, even if it's positive. But once replaced, that element is positive and becomes a maximum sum subarray. So, if another element needs to be replaced, but it's also part of the maximum sum subarray (the positive element), then replacing that is not possible until we replace the positive element again.

This complicates things. For example, suppose after converting all elements to negative, we need to replace elements in positions 1 and 2 with positive values. After replacing position 1 with a positive value, the maximum sum is that element. So, replacing position 2 is not possible unless we replace the entire array (which has a sum higher than the individual elements).

This seems like a dead end.

So, this approach works only if the target array has all elements non-positive. But in the third sample input, the target array has 6 and -1, which are positive. So, in that case, how to proceed.

The third sample input:

a is [-5, 9, -3,5,-9], which has elements 9,5 which are positive.

The target array is [-6,6,-1,-9].

So, the target array has 6 and -1 (positive). So, after converting a into all negatives, how to replace elements to get 6?

Perhaps the solution is to replace the entire array once it's all negatives. For example, the array is all negatives, then replace a subarray (which is individual elements) to get the desired elements, even if they are positive. But then, the new elements would be positive, and their sum would be higher than the other elements. So, any subsequent replacement must target those positive elements.

But how.

In the third sample's solution:

The steps are:

1. Replace positions 2-4 (9,-3,5) with -5. Now array becomes [-5, -5, -9]. 

Wait, no. Let's check the demo's solution:

The third test case's output is:

3 operations:

2 4 1 → -5 

1 1 1 → -6 

2 2 2 →6 -1 

Wait, perhaps after the first replacement, the array becomes [-5, -5, -9], but the next steps replace elements.

But how does this lead to the target array.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is to find the maximum sum subarrays and replace them in a way that builds the target array.

But it's challenging to see the pattern.

Another idea: the problem's constraints allow the sum of replacement lengths to be up to n + m. So, perhaps the solution is to replace each differing element in a with the corresponding element in b, provided that during the process, each replacement is a maximum sum subarray.

But how to ensure that.

For example, in the third test case:

Original a is [-5,9,-3,5,-9]

Target b is [-6,6,-1,-9]

The first operation replaces positions 2-4 (9,-3,5) with -5. The sum of this subarray is 9 + (-3) +5 =11, which is the maximum sum. So, replacing it with [-5] (sum -5) reduces the maximum sum. Then, the array becomes [-5, -5, -9]. Then replace first element (sum -5) with -6. The array is [-6, -5, -9]. Then replace the second element (sum -5) with 6 and -1. Now the array is [-6,6,-1,-9]. This matches the target.

So, the steps are:

1. Replace the maximum sum subarray (9,-3,5) sum 11 with -5.

Then, replace the first element (sum -5) with -6.

Then, replace the second element (sum -5) with 6,-1.

But how to ensure that these steps are possible.

The first replacement is allowed because the subarray is the maximum sum.

After the first replacement, the array is [-5, -5, -9]. The sum of the entire array is -19. The maximum subarray sum is the first element (-5), second (-5), third (-9), etc. So each element is a maximum sum subarray (since all are -5 or -9). Wait, the maximum sum would be -5. So any element with value -5 is a maximum sum subarray. The third element is -9, which is not a maximum sum subarray.

Wait, in the array [-5, -5, -9], the subarrays are:

[-5] sum -5

[-5, -5] sum -10

[-5, -5, -9] sum -19

[-5] sum -5

[-5, -9] sum -14

[-9] sum -9

So the maximum sum is -5. So any of the first two elements (value -5) are maximum sum subarrays. The third element (-9) is not.

So, after the first replacement, the array is [-5, -5, -9]. So, the next step replaces the first element (sum -5) with -6. The array becomes [-6, -5, -9]. Now, the maximum sum subarray is -5 (the second element). So, the next step replaces the second element (sum -5) with [6, -1]. The new array becomes [-6, 6, -1, -9]. Now, the maximum sum subarray is 6 (the second element). So, if there are any other elements to replace, we need to address them.

In this case, the target array is achieved.

So, the process is to first replace the maximum sum subarray, then replace individual elements that are part of the maximum sum subarray.

But how to model this.

This suggests that the steps involve:

1. Identify the maximum sum subarray in the current array.

2. Replace it with a new array that matches the corresponding part of the target array, or a part that helps in making further replacements.

But how to find which subarray to replace and with what.

Alternatively, the solution can be to replace the maximum sum subarray with a new array that contains the elements from the target array. For example, in the third sample, the maximum sum subarray is [9,-3,5], which is replaced with [-5], but this is part of the target array.

But how to align the target array's segments with the maximum sum subarrays.

Alternatively, the approach is to find all segments in b that are not present in a, and find a way to replace them via maximum sum subarrays.

But this is not straightforward.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement a solution where:

- We first replace all maximum sum subarrays in a until the array consists of all elements that are individual maximum sum subarrays (i.e., all elements are equal to the current maximum sum, which could be negative).

- Then, replace each element that differs from the target array.

But how to implement this.

The steps could be:

1. While there exists a maximum sum subarray of size greater than 1:

   a. Replace it with a single element, which is part of the target array.

But this may not work.

Alternatively, for each maximum sum subarray, replace it with the corresponding segment in the target array. But how to find which segment.

Alternatively, the solution is to find the positions in a where the elements differ from b, and for each such position, replace the maximum sum subarray that includes it.

But this requires that the maximum sum subarray can be chosen to include that position.

This is getting quite complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the solution is possible if and only if the target array can be formed by merging certain segments of the original array via replacements of maximum sum subarrays.

But how to check this.

Alternatively, considering the problem's sample outputs, the steps involve multiple operations that replace individual elements once the array is all negatives. This suggests that the solution is to first make the array all negative, then replace elements as needed.

So, the steps are:

1. Make the array all negative by repeatedly replacing the current maximum sum subarray with a negative element.

2. Once all elements are negative, replace each element to match the target array.

But how to handle cases where the target array has positive elements.

For example, if the target array has a positive element, after replacing the corresponding element, it becomes a maximum sum subarray. To replace other elements, we need to replace that positive element again.

But how.

Alternatively, the steps can be:

a. Make the array all negative.

b. Replace elements from right to left. For each element in the target array, if it's different from the current array's element, replace it. Since each element is a maximum sum subarray (because they are negative), this is allowed.

But if the target element is positive, replacing it will create a new maximum sum subarray (the positive element). So, after that, any subsequent replacement must replace that positive element.

But if the target array has multiple positive elements, this approach may not work.

But in the third sample, the target array has 6 and -1. How was this handled?

In the third sample, after making the array all negative (step 1), the array becomes [-5, -5, -9]. Then, the first element is replaced with -6 (still negative). The second element is replaced with 6 and -1. But 6 is positive. But after this replacement, the array is [-6, 6, -1, -9]. The maximum sum subarray is 6 (the second element). So, in this step, we replaced the second element (which was a maximum sum subarray) with 6 and -1. So this is allowed because in the previous step, the array was [-6, -5, -9], and the second element is -5 (which is part of the maximum sum subarray).

So, the replacement of the second element (sum -5) with 6 and -1 creates a new array where the sum of the new subarray is 6 + (-1) =5, which is higher than the previous maximum sum of -5. But during this step, the maximum sum subarray was the second element (sum -5). So, the replacement is allowed, and the new array has a higher maximum sum.

But this creates a new maximum sum subarray (6), which may be problematic for subsequent steps. However, in this case, the target array is already achieved after this step.

So, in cases where the target array has positive elements, the solution involves replacing a negative element (which is a maximum sum subarray) with a positive element, which then becomes the new maximum sum. But if there are no further steps, this is acceptable.

Thus, the approach is:

1. Convert the array into all negative elements.

2. Replace elements from right to left (or left to right) with the target elements. For each element in the target array:

   a. If the current element in a is the same as the target, do nothing.

   b. Else, replace the current element with the target element(s). If the target element is positive, this is allowed as long as the current element is a maximum sum subarray (which it is, since the array is all negative).

But when replacing a single element (which is part of a maximum sum subarray) with multiple elements, the sum of the new elements can be higher, but since the current element is being replaced, it's allowed.

So, the key is that during the replacement step, the subarray being replaced is a maximum sum subarray. Once replaced, the new elements may have a higher sum, but that's okay as long as no further steps are needed.

So, the algorithm is:

For each test case:

1. Check if it's possible to convert a into b. The condition is that the elements of b can be obtained by replacing certain subarrays of a (which are maximum sum subarrays) with the elements of b.

But how to check this.

Alternatively, the problem can be solved using the following steps:

- Convert a into an array of all negative elements by repeatedly replacing the maximum sum subarray with a single negative element.

- Then, replace each element in this array with the corresponding elements of b. This may require splitting elements into multiple elements.

But how to split.

For example, if the target array has more elements than the current array, we need to split some elements into multiple elements. Each split can be done by replacing a single element (a maximum sum subarray) with multiple elements.

So, during the replacement phase, each element can be replaced with any number of elements, provided that the subarray being replaced is a maximum sum subarray.

Thus, the algorithm is:

1. Make a all negative.

2. Now, each element is a maximum sum subarray.

3. For each element in the current array (which is negative), replace it with the corresponding elements of b, possibly inserting multiple elements.

But how to align the elements.

This approach may work if the target array can be split into contiguous segments that can be inserted into the current array via replacing individual elements (each of which is a maximum sum subarray).

But how to handle cases where the target array has elements in a different order.

Alternatively, the steps are:

1. While the current array's elements are not all negative:

   a. Find the maximum sum subarray.

   b. Replace it with a single element of value -1 (or any negative value).

2. Now, the array is all negative. For each position i in the array:

   a. If the current element is not part of the target array, replace it with the elements from the target array that should appear in this position. This may involve inserting multiple elements.

But how to track the positions, since replacing a single element with multiple elements changes the array's length.

Hmm.

But perhaps the way to proceed is to model the array as a list, and during each replacement, track the current array. Then, for each step, find the maximum sum subarray, replace it, and proceed.

But given the time constraints, it's challenging to model this for large arrays.

But given that the sum of n and m across test cases is up to 500, perhaps this is manageable.

But the problem requires that we construct the sequence of operations, which makes it even more challenging.

An alternative approach is to note that the problem allows us to use up to n + m total replacement elements, which suggests that the solution can be done with O(n + m) operations.

The key insight is to first make the array all negatives, then replace each element with the corresponding elements of b.

But how to handle cases where the target array has more elements than the original array.

For example, if the original array has length 2 and the target array has length 3, we can replace one of the elements with two elements to increase the length.

But each replacement must be of a maximum sum subarray. So, in the phase where the array is all negatives, each element is a maximum sum subarray. So, replacing a single element (length 1) with multiple elements (length k) is allowed.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Make the array all negatives. Each element can be replaced.

2. Replace elements in the current array with the elements of b. For this:

   a. Start from the left of the current array and the left of the target array.

   b. For each position, compare the current element in the array with the target element.

   c. If they match, move to the next.

   d. If they don't match, replace the current element (which is a maximum sum subarray) with the corresponding elements from the target array. This may require replacing one element with multiple elements, which increases the length of the array.

But how to handle cases where the target array is longer than the initial array after making all elements negative.

This approach would work if after replacing elements, the target array can be formed by expanding the array's length via multiple replacements.

But how to track the positions.

For example, in the third sample, the target array has 4 elements. The original a has 5 elements. After making all elements negative, the array has 3 elements. Then, during the replacement steps, one element is replaced with two elements (6, -1), increasing the length to 4, which matches the target.

Thus, the algorithm works by expanding or contracting the array as needed.

So, the plan is:

For each test case:

1. Check if it's possible to transform a into b. How?

   a. The answer is possible if after replacing maximum sum subarrays, the elements can be arranged into b. But this is not straightforward to check.

   But perhaps the answer is possible if and only if the elements of b can be partitioned into segments that can be inserted into the array through replacements of maximum sum subarrays. But how to verify this.

   Alternatively, the answer is always possible as long as the sum of the elements in a can be manipulated to form b. But the problem statement's sample input 2 is a case where it's impossible.

Sample input 2:

a is [-2, -2], target is [2]. So, the sum of a is -4. The maximum sum subarray is -2. So, each element can be replaced. To form [2], we need to replace the first element (sum -2) with 2, which makes the array [2, -2]. Then, the maximum sum subarray is 2, which can be replaced with [2], but then the array would be [2, -2] again. Or, replace the entire array (if possible). But the sum of the array is 0, which is higher than each element. So, the maximum sum subarray is 2 (the first element). So, the array can't be replaced in one step. Hence, it's impossible. Hence, the output is -1.

So, the answer is impossible if the target array cannot be formed through these operations. So, there must be some constraints on the target array.

But how to determine this.

Alternatively, the problem is possible if and only if the target array can be formed by merging or splitting segments of the original array, with the merges and splits allowed by the operation steps.

But this is vague.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the following steps:

- For each test case:

   a. Check if the sum of the entire array is the maximum subarray sum. If yes, replace the entire array with b. If this is possible (i.e., the sum of the entire array is the maximum sum), then output this operation.

   b. Otherwise, proceed to make the array all negative by replacing maximum sum subarrays with single negative elements.

   c. Once the array is all negative, replace each element with the corresponding elements of b. This may require splitting or merging elements.

But how to implement this.

But how to determine whether the target array can be formed after making the array all negative.

For example, sample input 2: a is [-2, -2], target is [2]. After making the array all negative (which it already is), we replace the first element with 2. The array becomes [2, -2]. The maximum sum is 2. To get to [2], we need to replace the entire array (sum 0). But the maximum sum subarray is 2. So, can't replace the entire array. Hence, it's impossible.

So, the problem is impossible in this case.

So, the condition is that after making the array all negative, we can replace individual elements to form the target array, but this may not be possible if the target array has a sum higher than the sum of the individual elements.

But how to check this.

Alternatively, the problem is possible only if the target array can be formed by replacing individual elements (possibly merging or splitting them) when the array is all negative.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the following steps:

1. For each test case, first check if the entire array can be replaced with b in one step. This is possible if the maximum subarray sum of a is equal to the sum of the entire array.

   a. If yes, check if replacing the entire array with b is possible. If yes, output this operation.

   b. If not, proceed.

2. Otherwise, try to convert a into all negative elements by repeatedly replacing the maximum sum subarrays with a single negative element. Each replacement reduces the maximum sum.

3. Once the array is all negative, replace individual elements to match the target array. For each element in b:

   a. If the current element in the array does not match, replace it with the desired elements. This may require splitting or merging elements.

But how to track this.

But since the array can change length during each operation, this requires careful management.

But perhaps the key is to note that once the array is all negative, each element is a maximum sum subarray, so we can replace any element, and any sequence of elements in the target array can be formed by replacing individual elements, possibly splitting or merging them.

But this is not necessarily true.

For example, in sample input 2, the target array is [2], which is a single element. But the array after making all elements negative is already [-2, -2]. To reach [2], we need to replace both elements with 2. But after replacing the first element (sum -2) with 2, the array becomes [2, -2]. The maximum sum subarray is 2. Replacing this would require replacing the first element again. But then the array would become [2] only if the entire array is replaced. But the entire array's sum is 0, which is not the maximum subarray sum (which is 2). So, this is impossible.

Thus, the problem is impossible.

Thus, the general approach is possible only if the target array can be formed by replacing individual elements when the array is all negative, and the sum of the target array's elements is not higher than the maximum subarray sum at any step.

But this is not clear.

Given the time constraints, I think the correct approach is to:

- For each test case, first check if the entire array can be replaced with b in one step.

- If not, proceed to convert a into all negative elements by replacing each maximum sum subarray with a negative element.

- Once all elements are negative, check if the target array can be formed by replacing elements in the current array. For example, the current array after making all elements negative is C. Check if C can be transformed into b by replacing each element with a sequence of elements from b, where each replacement is a single element in C being replaced with a subarray from b.

But how to align this.

Alternatively, during the phase of replacing elements after making all elements negative, we can replace elements in C with the corresponding parts of b. For example, if the current array is [x, y, z], and the target array is [a, b, c], then replace each x, y, z with a, b, c. If the target array has more elements, split some elements into multiple elements. If the target array has fewer, merge elements by replacing them with fewer elements.

But how to manage this.

Given that the problem allows any sequence of operations as long as each step replaces a maximum sum subarray, and the sum of the replacement lengths is at most n + m, perhaps the correct approach is to:

- Make the array all negative.

- Then, replace the entire array with the target array. But this is possible only if the entire array is a maximum sum subarray. Which is possible if all elements are negative (sum of array is negative) and the target array's sum is higher than any individual element's sum.

But this may not be the case.

Alternatively, during the phase when the array is all negative, the sum of the entire array is the sum of the elements (all negative). The maximum sum subarray is the largest individual element (the least negative). So, the entire array is a maximum sum subarray only if all elements are the same.

Otherwise, the maximum sum subarray is the individual element with the highest value.

Thus, during the phase when the array is all negative, the maximum sum subarray is the individual elements. So, each element can be replaced.

But when the array has elements with different values, the maximum sum subarray is the largest element. So, only that element can be replaced.

Thus, to make all elements replaceable, the array must be made to have all elements equal.

So, after making all elements negative, we need to replace each element until all elements are equal.

This adds more steps.

Given the time constraints and the complexity of this problem, perhaps the correct approach is to refer to the sample solution and think of how to model it.

The sample solution for the first test case involves replacing each differing element by making sure that during each step, the replaced subarray is a maximum sum subarray.

The solution for the third test case involves replacing a maximum sum subarray (9, -3, 5) sum 11 with -5, then replacing individual elements.

Thus, the key is to identify the maximum sum subarray and replace it with part of the target array.

But how to find which part to replace.

Thus, the algorithm is:

For each test case:

1. Check if the entire array can be replaced with b in one step.

   a. If yes, output that.

2. Otherwise:

   a. While the current array is not equal to b:

      i. Find the maximum sum subarray.

      ii. Replace it with a part of the target array.

But how to determine which part.

Alternatively, the algorithm is to greedily replace the rightmost maximum sum subarray with a part of the target array.

But how to align this.

This approach is similar to the sample solutions.

But without a clear pattern, it's difficult to proceed.

Thus, the problem requires a deep understanding of the maximum subarray sum and how each replacement affects the array's structure.

Given the time constraints, I think I'll need to proceed with implementing the following steps:

1. For each test case, check if the entire array's maximum sum is equal to the sum of the array. If yes, replace the entire array with b.

2. If not, then proceed to make the array all negative by replacing each maximum sum subarray with a negative element.

3. Once all elements are negative, replace each element with the corresponding elements in b. For elements that need to be split into multiple elements or merged, replace them accordingly.

But to implement this, we need to model each step.

This is a challenging problem, and the solution requires careful handling of each step. Given the time, I'll proceed to write code that follows this approach, but I'm not sure if it will cover all cases.

The code steps would be:

For each test case:

- Check if the maximum subarray sum equals the sum of the array. If yes, replace the entire array with b if possible.

- Else:

   Repeat:

      Find the maximum sum subarray.

      Replace it with a single element that is part of the target array or a negative value.

   Until all elements are negative.

   Then, replace each element with the corresponding elements in b.

But this is not fully correct, but given the time, this is the best I can do.
