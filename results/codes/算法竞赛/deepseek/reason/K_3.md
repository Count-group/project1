Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to compute the sum of the maximum number of matchings across all non-empty subsets of points on an n x m grid. Each subset forms a graph where edges connect points sharing the same row or column. The maximum matching is the largest set of edges with no shared vertices.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply. Let's think about what contributes to the maximum matching. In such a graph, the maximum matching is the sum of the maximum matchings in each connected component. But here, connected components are either rows or columns. Wait, no. Because a point is connected to others in the same row or column. So the graph is a bipartite graph where edges are between rows and columns. Wait, perhaps each point is a node, and edges connect to others in the same row or column. Hmm, but that's a bit different. Alternatively, the graph is formed by edges between points in the same row or column. So two points are connected if they are in the same row or same column.

But the maximum matching in this graph would be the largest set of edges (pairs of points) that don't share any vertex. Now, each edge can be either a horizontal edge (same row) or vertical (same column). However, once a point is matched in a row, it can't be part of another edge in that row or any column. So the maximum matching would be the sum of the maximum matchings in each row and column, but considering that a point can't be in both a row and column edge.

Wait, no. The maximum matching for the entire graph is not simply the sum of the maximum matchings in each row and each column, because points are shared between rows and columns. So this complicates things. For example, a point in a row can be part of a matching in that row, but then it can't be used in any column.

This suggests that the maximum matching is the maximum of either the sum of row-based matchings or column-based matchings. But that's not necessarily true. For example, in a grid, the maximum matching could involve some row edges and some column edges, but without overlapping points.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching is the maximum between the maximum row-based matching (summing each row's maximum) and the column-based one. But I'm not sure.

But according to the problem statement, the maximum matching is the maximum number of edges with no overlapping vertices. So the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching in a graph where edges connect points in the same row or column. However, this graph is a union of cliques (each row forms a clique, each column forms a clique). Because any two points in the same row are connected, and same for columns.

Wait, no. Because two points in the same row are connected by an edge. So each row is a clique, and each column is a clique. The graph is the union of all these cliques. The maximum matching in such a graph would be the maximum set of edges where no two edges share a vertex.

But in a clique, the maximum matching is floor(k/2), where k is the number of vertices in the clique. However, when multiple cliques are connected (since a point can be in a row and a column), the maximum matching isn't straightforward. For example, if a point is in both a row and column clique, using an edge from one clique precludes using edges from the other that include that point.

This complicates the problem. So the maximum matching for the entire graph is not simply the sum of floor(k_i/2) for each row and column, but a more complex calculation.

But according to some research, when the graph is a line graph of a bipartite graph, the maximum matching can be found in polynomial time. However, perhaps for this specific problem, there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be split into considering row edges and column edges separately, and the maximum matching is the sum of the maximum row-based matching plus the maximum column-based matching, but ensuring that the points used are disjoint. But this seems complicated.

However, the problem asks for the sum over all possible non-empty subsets. Each subset is a set of points, and the graph is formed by edges between points in the same row or column of the subset. For each subset, compute the maximum matching size, then sum all these sizes modulo 998244353.

Given that n and m are up to 500, a brute force approach is impossible. We need a mathematical approach to calculate this sum efficiently.

Let me think about each possible edge. But edges are between points in the same row or column. However, the maximum matching depends on the structure of the subset. So the challenge is to find a way to model the contribution of each possible edge to the sum.

But perhaps there's a way to model the sum as the sum over all possible subsets of the maximum matching size for that subset.

Another approach is inclusion-exclusion. For each possible edge pair (i.e., each possible edge in the graph formed by a subset), determine how many subsets have that edge in their maximum matching. Then sum over all edges the number of subsets where the edge is part of the maximum matching. However, this seems difficult because edges can't be considered independently; the presence of one edge affects the others.

Alternatively, think about the maximum matching for a subset. The maximum matching is the largest possible set of edges with no overlapping vertices. Thus, the maximum matching size is equal to the maximum vertex-disjoint set of edges. This is equivalent to the maximum matching problem on a graph, which is known to be solvable in polynomial time for bipartite graphs. However, in our case, the graph is a union of cliques (rows and columns), which may not be bipartite. Wait, rows and columns form cliques. So the graph is a union of cliques. However, the maximum matching in such a graph can be found by considering each clique and taking floor(k/2) edges, but ensuring that the selected edges don't overlap across cliques.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching is the maximum between the sum of floor(k_i/2) over all rows and the sum of floor(l_j/2) over all columns, where k_i is the number of points in row i, and l_j is the number of points in column j. Because choosing row edges would require not using any column edges, and vice versa. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, a subset could have points arranged such that some row edges and column edges can coexist without overlapping vertices.

But perhaps the maximum matching is the maximum between the row-based matching and the column-based matching, where the row-based matching is the sum of floor(k_i/2) for each row, and the column-based is the sum of floor(l_j/2) for each column. Then the overall maximum matching would be the maximum of these two values. Because if you choose row edges, you can't use any column edges (since the points are already part of row edges), and vice versa. But this might not hold in all cases. Let's see:

Suppose in a subset, some rows have even numbers of points and columns have even numbers. Then the row-based sum and column-based sum could be equal, but maybe combining some row and column edges would give a higher total. However, that's not possible because once a point is used in a row edge, it can't be used in a column edge. So the maximum matching can't be larger than the maximum of the row-based sum and the column-based sum.

Wait, but let's take an example. Suppose we have two points in the same row and two points in the same column. For example, a 2x2 grid, and the subset includes all four points. The maximum row-based sum is 1 (each row has two points, sum is 1+1=2). The column-based sum is also 2. The maximum matching is 2. But if we pair row-wise, two edges (each row gives one edge). Similarly for columns. But if we try to mix, like take one row edge and one column edge, but they must not share points. For example, in the 2x2 grid, the points are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). If we pair (1,1)-(1,2) (row edge) and (2,1)-(2,2) (another row edge), total 2. Alternatively, pair column edges. Or, (1,1)-(2,1) (column edge) and (1,2)-(2,2) (column edge), total 2. Or, (1,1)-(1,2) and (2,1)-(2,2), same result. So the maximum is 2. So the row-based and column-based sums are both 2, and the maximum is 2.

Another example: a subset of three points arranged in a row. The maximum matching is 1 (floor(3/2) = 1). If there's a point in another row, but no column overlaps, perhaps that can add to the sum. But perhaps not. So in general, the maximum matching is the maximum between the row-based sum and the column-based sum.

If this is true, then the sum over all subsets is the sum for each subset S of max(A(S), B(S)), where A(S) is the row-based sum (sum over rows of floor(k_i/2)), and B(S) is the column-based sum (sum over columns of floor(l_j/2)).

Then, the total sum is sum_{S} max(A(S), B(S)).

This seems plausible, but I need to verify. Let's take the sample input where n=1, m=2. The possible non-empty subsets are all subsets with 1 or 2 points. For the subset with two points (same row), the maximum matching is 1 (floor(2/2)=1). So sum is 1. For the other subsets (each single point), maximum matching is 0. So total sum is 1. Which matches the sample input.

Another sample input: n=2, m=2. The demo output is 10. Let's see. Each subset is non-empty, and we need to compute the max(A, B) for each. For example, the subset of all four points: A=2 (each row has two points, sum 1+1=2), B=2 (each column has two points). So max is 2. How many subsets contribute to this? Let's see. But this is getting complicated.

Assuming that the maximum is max(A, B), then the sum is sum_{S} max(A(S), B(S)). How can we compute this efficiently?

The problem is to compute sum_{S} max(A(S), B(S)), where S is any non-empty subset of the grid points.

But the grid has n rows and m columns. Let's model A(S) and B(S) in terms of the points chosen.

For each row i, the contribution to A(S) is floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the number of points in row i in subset S. Similarly for columns.

Thus, the sum can be written as sum_{S} max( sum_i floor(k_i/2), sum_j floor(l_j/2) ), where l_j is the number of points in column j in subset S.

But this seems challenging to compute directly. However, we can use the linearity of expectation or inclusion-exclusion principles.

Alternatively, we can split the sum into three parts:

sum_{S} max(A, B) = sum_S (A + B - min(A, B)) ) = sum_S A + sum_S B - sum_S min(A,B).

Thus, the total sum is sumR + sumC - sumMin, where sumR is the sum of A over all subsets, sumC is the sum of B over all subsets, and sumMin is the sum of min(A,B) over all subsets.

If we can compute sumR, sumC, and sumMin, then the answer is sumR + sumC - sumMin.

So the problem reduces to computing these three terms.

Let's start with sumR and sumC. These are easier.

sumR is the sum over all subsets S of sum_i floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the number of points in row i of S.

This can be rewritten as sum_i (sum over subsets S of floor(k_i(S)/2) * product_{j !=i} (number of ways to choose any points in other rows)).

Because for a given row i, the contribution to sumR from row i is floor(k_i/2) multiplied by the number of ways to choose points in other rows (each can be present or not). The subsets where row i has k_i points, and other rows have any possible combination.

So for each row i, the contribution is:

sum_{k=0 to m} floor(k/2) * C(m, k) * 2^{(n-1)m} - 1.

Wait, no. Because for each row i, the number of subsets where row i has exactly k points is C(m, k) multiplied by the product of (number of ways to choose points in other rows). For other rows, each can have any number of points (including zero). But the entire subset S must be non-empty. So the total number of subsets where row i has k points is C(m, k) * (2^{m(n-1)}). However, since the entire subset must be non-empty, we need to subtract the case where all other rows have zero points and row i has k points. Wait, but for sumR, each term is floor(k_i/2) * [number of subsets where row i has k_i points, and any combination in other rows (including zero, but the overall subset is non-empty)].

But actually, the sum includes all non-empty subsets. So for a given row i and k_i points in it, the number of subsets is C(m, k_i) multiplied by the product for the other (n-1) rows, each of which can have any number of points (0 or more). However, the entire subset must be non-empty. So the total subsets where row i has k_i points is C(m, k_i) * (product_{other rows} (2^m)) ) - (if k_i ==0, then these subsets are when other rows are non-empty, else they can be any). Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, the total number of subsets where row i has k_i points is C(m, k_i) * (2^{m(n-1)}). Because for each of the other (n-1) rows, each can have any subset of points (each has 2^m possibilities). So for each row i, the number of subsets where row i has exactly k points is C(m, k) * 2^{m(n-1)}. However, this includes the case where all other rows are empty. So the total subsets counted here is for row i having k points, and any combination of other rows. But since we need to count all non-empty subsets, when k is zero, the subsets counted are those where other rows are non-empty. So for row i's contribution, when k is zero, it's not counted (since floor(0/2) is zero anyway). So the sum over k=0 to m of floor(k/2)*C(m, k)*2^{m(n-1)} } for each row i.

But then, since there are n rows, sumR is n multiplied by the sum over k=0 to m of floor(k/2) * C(m, k) * 2^{m(n-1)}.

But wait, the term 2^{m(n-1)} is the number of ways to choose any points in the other rows. So for each row i, the contribution is sum_{k=0}^m [floor(k/2) * C(m, k) * 2^{m(n-1)} ].

But this would include the empty subset (when k=0 and all other rows are empty). But since the problem requires non-empty subsets, we need to subtract those cases.

Wait, the total number of subsets for row i's contribution is the sum over k=0 to m of C(m, k) * 2^{m(n-1)}} for each k. But when k is 0, the other rows can be any subset, including empty. So the case where all rows are empty is included here. But in the problem statement, the subset must be non-empty. So for each row i's contribution, the term for k=0 (floor(0/2) = 0) is multiplied by 2^{m(n-1)}, which includes the empty subset. So when summing over all rows, the empty subset is counted multiple times (once for each row i where k_i=0 and other rows are empty). But since the empty subset is not part of the problem, these need to be subtracted.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the sum for all subsets (including empty) and then subtract the empty subset's contribution (which is zero). Because the problem statement says non-empty subsets. So sumR is sum over all non-empty subsets S of sum_i floor(k_i(S)/2). But sum over all subsets (including empty) would be n * sum_{k=0}^m [floor(k/2)*C(m, k) * 2^{m(n-1)} } ] minus the empty subset's contribution (which is zero, since when S is empty, all k_i are zero). So the sumR is n * sum_{k=0}^m [floor(k/2) * C(m, k) * 2^{m(n-1)} } ].

Wait, but for each row i, the number of subsets where row i has k points is C(m, k) multiplied by 2^{m(n-1)}, which includes the case where all other rows are empty and k=0 (i.e., the empty subset). So when we sum for all rows, the empty subset is counted n times (once for each row i where k_i=0 and other rows are empty). But the empty subset is not part of the sum, so we need to subtract the contribution of the empty subset. But since the empty subset's contribution to sumR is zero (each floor(0/2) is zero), the sum over all subsets (including empty) of sumR is equal to the sum over non-empty subsets. So we can compute sumR as n * sum_{k=0}^m [floor(k/2)*C(m, k) * 2^{m(n-1)} } ].

But the empty subset's contribution is zero, so it can be ignored. So sumR is n * sum_{k=0}^m [floor(k/2)*C(m, k)} * 2^{m(n-1)} } ].

Similarly, sumC is m * sum_{k=0}^n [floor(k/2)*C(n, k)} * 2^{n(m-1)} } ].

But let's compute sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k)}.

Let's compute this sum for general m.

sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k) = sum_{k=0}^m (k//2) * C(m, k).

This can be split into even and odd k.

For even k=2t: contribution is t * C(m, 2t).

For odd k=2t+1: contribution is t * C(m, 2t+1).

So sum_{t=0}^{floor(m/2)} t*C(m, 2t) + sum_{t=0}^{floor((m-1)/2)} t*C(m, 2t+1).

This can be simplified. Let's find a closed-form expression.

Let’s consider generating functions. The generating function for floor(k/2) is complicated, but perhaps we can find a way.

Alternatively, note that:

sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) C(m, k) = sum_{k=0}^m (k - (k mod 2))/2 * C(m, k) = 1/2 [ sum_{k=0}^m k C(m, k) - sum_{k=0}^m (k mod 2) C(m, k) ].

Sum_{k=0}^m k C(m, k) = m*2^{m-1}.

Sum_{k=0}^m (k mod 2) C(m, k) = sum_{k odd} C(m, k) = 2^{m-1}.

So substituting back:

sum = 1/2 [ m*2^{m-1} - 2^{m-1} ] = 2^{m-2} (m-1).

This is valid when m >= 1. For m=0, sum is 0.

So the sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) C(m, k) is (m-1) * 2^{m-2} for m >= 1, else 0.

This is a crucial simplification!

Thus, for row i's contribution, sum_{k} floor(k/2)*C(m, k) is (m-1)*2^{m-2} when m >= 2, 0 when m=0 or 1.

So sumR for each row is:

if m >= 2, then (m-1)*2^{m-2} * 2^{m(n-1)} }, else 0.

So sumR = n * ( (m-1) * 2^{m-2} ) * 2^{m(n-1)} ) mod MOD.

Simplify the exponent:

2^{m-2} * 2^{m(n-1)} } = 2^{ m-2 + m(n-1) } = 2^{m(n-1) + m -2} = 2^{m n -2}.

So sumR = n * (m-1) * 2^{m n - 2} mod MOD.

But this holds when m >= 2. For m < 2, sumR is zero.

Similarly, sumC = m * (n-1) * 2^{n m - 2} mod MOD when n >= 2, else zero.

So sumR and sumC can be computed as:

sumR = 0 if m < 2, else n*(m-1)*pow(2, n*m -2) mod MOD.

sumC = 0 if n < 2, else m*(n-1)*pow(2, n*m -2) mod MOD.

But wait, for m=1, the sumR is zero. For m=2, it's n*(1)*2^{2n-2} ?

Wait, let's test with the sample input.

Sample Input 1: 1 1.

sumR is 0 (since m=1 < 2), sumC is 0 (since n=1 < 2). sumMin is zero. So result is 0, which matches the first sample.

Sample Input 2: 1 2.

sumR = 1 * (2-1) * 2^{1*2 - 2} = 1 *1* 2^0 = 1.

sumC = 2 * (1-1) * ... = 0.

sumMin is zero (since either sumR or sumC is zero, or something else? Wait, for n=1, m=2. Each subset S is non-empty. sumR is 1, sumC is 0. sumMin is min(1, 0) for each subset. But sumMin is sum of min(A, B) for all subsets. But sumC is zero, so sumMin would be zero.

So total sum is 1 +0 -0=1, which matches the second sample.

Another sample: 2 2.

sumR = 2*(2-1)*2^(4-2) = 2*1*4=8.

sumC= 2*(2-1)*2^(4-2) = same as sumR, 8.

sumMin is sum of min(A, B) for all subsets. So sumR + sumC - sumMin = 8+8 - sumMin = 16 - sumMin. The sample output is 10. So 16 - sumMin =10 → sumMin=6. So in this case, sumMin is 6.

So sumMin must be computed correctly.

But how to compute sumMin?

sumMin is the sum over all non-empty subsets S of min(A(S), B(S)), where A(S) is the sum of floor(k_i/2) for rows, B(S) is sum of floor(l_j/2) for columns.

Computing this is the hardest part. We need to find an efficient way to compute this sum.

Hmm. Let's think about the properties. For a given subset S, A and B are the row and column sums. We need to compute min(A, B) for all S.

Let’s consider that for each subset S, min(A, B) can be written as sum_{t=1}^\infty [A >= t and B >=t]. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, we can model the problem using generating functions. For each possible way points are chosen, compute A and B, and track the minimum of the two.

But with n and m up to 500, it's not feasible to process each row and column separately. We need a dynamic programming approach that can track the possible sums of A and B.

Let’s think of the problem as follows:

Each row contributes a certain amount to A, based on the number of points selected in that row. Similarly, each column contributes to B based on the number of points selected.

But since the points are selected in a grid, the number of points in a row and column are not independent. For example, choosing a point (i,j) increases the count in row i and column j.

This interdependency makes it challenging to model the problem.

However, for the sumMin term, we need to compute the sum of min(A, B) over all subsets. Since A and B are dependent variables, perhaps there's a way to model this with generating functions where each row and column's contribution is accounted for, and the minimum is tracked.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the sum as:

sumMin = sum_{a=0}^\infty sum_{b=0}^a} [number of subsets S where A(S) =a and B(S) >=a} ].

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, note that min(A, B) = A + B - max(A, B). But since we have sumR = sumA, sumC = sumB, then sumMin = sumA + sumB - sumMax, where sumMax is sum of max(A, B). But the original sum is sumMax = sumR + sumC - sumMin. So this approach doesn't directly help.

Another idea: since min(A, B) = (A + B - |A - B|) / 2.

So sumMin = sum_{S} (A(S) + B(S) - |A(S) - B(S)|) / 2.

But then sumMin = (sumR + sumC - sum|A-B| ) / 2.

So if we can compute sum|A-B|, then sumMin can be derived.

But how to compute sum|A-B| for all subsets.

This seems challenging, but perhaps there's a way to model this with generating functions.

But even this approach might be complicated. Let's think again.

Let me think of each row and column as contributing to A and B. For each row, the contribution to A is floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the number of points selected in the row. For each column, the contribution to B is floor(l_j/2), where l_j is the number of points selected in the column.

We need to model the selection of points such that for each row and column, their contributions are computed, and then the min of the two sums is taken.

But modeling this for all subsets is difficult.

An alternative approach is to note that when points are selected, the contribution to A and B is additive. So for each subset S, A(S) = sum_i a_i, where a_i = floor(k_i/2), and B(S) = sum_j b_j, where b_j = floor(l_j/2).

Thus, A and B are functions of the selection of points. The problem is to compute the sum over all non-empty subsets of min(A, B).

Let’s consider dynamic programming. For each row, when we select some points, we compute how much they contribute to A. For each column, similarly. But the selection of points in rows and columns are dependent, since a point is part of a row and a column.

Wait, but the selection of points is arbitrary. So the DP state would need to track the number of points in each row and column. However, this is not feasible for n and m up to 500.

Another idea: Since the contributions to A and B are additive and depend only on the number of points in each row and column, perhaps we can model the DP state as the current sum of A and B, and track the possible pairs (A, B) that can be achieved. But even this is challenging, as the sum can be up to (n * m/2) for both A and B.

But given that n and m are up to 500, the maximum possible A is n * floor(m/2), and similarly for B. For m=500, each row can contribute up to 250, so for n=500, A can be up to 500 * 250 = 125,000. Similarly for B. Tracking all possible pairs (A, B) up to 125,000 each is not feasible.

Thus, this approach would not be efficient enough.

Alternative approach: Let's find a way to compute the sumMin for all possible subsets by considering the generating functions for A and B.

The generating function for A is the product over all rows of (1 + x^{floor(0/2} * (sum_{k=0}^m C(m, k) * x^{floor(k/2)} )) ... wait, no.

Actually, for each row, the contribution to A is floor(k_i/2) where k_i is the number of points selected in row i. The generating function for a single row's contribution to A is:

For each possible k_i (0 ≤ k_i ≤ m), when selecting k_i points, the contribution is floor(k_i/2). The generating function for this row is:

sum_{k_i=0}^m C(m, k_i) * x^{floor(k_i/2)}.

Similarly, for each column, the generating function is sum_{l_j=0}^n C(n, l_j) * y^{floor(l_j/2)}.

The overall generating function for A and B would then be the product of all row generating functions multiplied by the product of all column generating functions. However, this is not correct, because selecting a point in a row affects both the row and the column. Thus, the generating functions for rows and columns are not independent.

This interdependency makes generating functions approach challenging.

Another idea: Since each point's selection contributes to exactly one row and one column, perhaps the generating function can be modeled as a product over all points. For each point (i,j), choosing to include or exclude it affects the count of points in row i and column j. However, this would require tracking for each row and column their current point counts, which is again infeasible for large n and m.

But perhaps there's a way to separate the contributions. Let’s consider that the sumMin is equal to the sum over all possible a and b of min(a, b) multiplied by the number of subsets S where A(S) =a and B(S) =b.

But the problem is to compute this sum efficiently. 

Let’s think of the problem in terms of generating functions. For all possible subsets, the generating function G(x, y) would be the product over all points (i,j) of (1 + x^{delta_i} y^{delta_j}), where delta_i is 1 if the point is in row i and delta_j is 1 if in column j. But this is not correct. Instead, each point (i,j) contributes to the count of points in row i and column j. The contribution to A is floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the number of points in row i. Similarly for B. So the generating function for each row i is sum_{k_i} C(m, k_i) x^{floor(k_i/2)} }.

The same applies to each column j. However, the problem is that the selection of points in rows and columns is not independent. For example, selecting a point (i,j) increases k_i and l_j by 1.

This makes the problem complex because the variables k_i and l_j are dependent.

But for the purpose of generating functions, perhaps we can model each row's contribution to A and each column's contribution to B.

But how?

Alternatively, let's consider that the sumMin can be written as:

sumMin = sum_{S} min(A(S), B(S)) = sum_{S} sum_{t=1}^\infty [t <= A(S) and t <= B(S)}.

This is equivalent to sum_{t=1}^\infty the number of subsets S where A(S) >= t and B(S) >= t.

But this might not be directly helpful, but it's worth exploring.

So, sumMin = sum_{t=1}^\infty c(t), where c(t) is the number of subsets S where A(S) >= t and B(S) >= t.

But how to compute c(t)? For each t, we need to find the number of subsets S such that both A(S) and B(S) are at least t.

But even this is not straightforward. However, note that t can be up to the maximum possible value of min(A(S), B(S)), which is up to min(n * floor(m/2), m * floor(n/2)) ). For n and m up to 500, this can be up to 500 * 250 = 125,000. So iterating over t up to 1e5 is not feasible.

Thus, this approach is not practical.

Alternative Idea: Let's note that min(A, B) = sum_{k=1}^\infty [k <=A and k <= B}. This allows us to represent sumMin as the sum over all subsets S of the number of integers k such that k <= A and k <= B. But this doesn't immediately help with computation.

Another Idea: Given that sumMin is the sum over all subsets of min(A,B), perhaps we can find a way to compute this by considering the contributions of each possible pair (A, B) and counting the number of subsets that lead to those pairs.

But again, tracking all possible pairs (A, B) is not feasible for large n and m.

Alternative Plan:

Given the time constraints and the problem's complexity, perhaps the sumMin term can be precomputed using dynamic programming, considering the contributions of each row and column incrementally.

Let’s consider building a dynamic programming state that tracks the current sum of A and B. For each row and column, we can track how their selection of points affects the sum.

But given the size of n and m, we need a way to compress the state.

Let's think of the DP state as follows:

dp[i][a][b] = the number of ways to choose points in the first i rows and columns such that the sum of A is a and sum of B is b.

But this is impossible due to the size.

Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric between rows and columns, perhaps there's a way to model the DP state in terms of the current sum of A and B, but in a way that allows us to compute the sumMin.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Since the sum of A and B can be up to O(nm), and sumMin is the sum of their minima, perhaps we can find a generating function approach where each row contributes to A and each column contributes to B.

For each row, the contribution to A is floor(k_i/2), and for each column, the contribution to B is floor(l_j/2). But the selection of points in rows and columns is interdependent.

This seems to require a multivariate generating function where each variable tracks the contributions to A and B.

But again, the interdependency between rows and columns makes this challenging.

Alternative Plan:

Given the time constraints, perhaps it's possible to find that sumMin is equal to zero when either n or m is 1. For example, if n=1, then B(S) is zero for all subsets (since there's only one row, columns are of size 1). So min(A, B) is zero. Hence, sumMin is zero when n=1 or m=1.

For other cases, perhaps sumMin can be computed using a DP approach that tracks the possible sums of A and B as we add rows and columns.

But given the time constraints and the problem's difficulty, it's possible that the correct approach is to realize that sumMin is equal to the sum over all possible subsets of the minimum of the row and column contributions, which can be computed using a generating function approach where each point's contribution is accounted for.

However, given the complexity and the time, perhaps the intended solution involves the following steps:

1. Compute sumR and sumC using the derived formulas.
2. Compute sumMin as the sum over all subsets where the row contributions are equal to the column contributions. But this is not necessarily correct.

Alternatively, given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that for the given constraints, sumMin is zero when either n or m is 1, and for other cases, sumMin is zero. But this is not the case, as seen in the sample input 2x2 where sumMin is 6.

Thus, the correct code must find a way to compute sumMin.

But given the time constraints and the difficulty of this part, perhaps the intended solution is to use inclusion-exclusion and precompute the sumR and sumC, and subtract the sumMin which is computed via another method.

But I'm stuck. Let's look for patterns or mathematical insights.

Another Idea:

Let’s consider that each subset S contributes to sumMin the minimum of the row-based sum and column-based sum. Since row-based and column-based sums are independent of each other (but not really, as the points are shared), perhaps for each subset S, the minimum is the minimum between two values that can be computed independently. However, this is not the case because the points are shared between rows and columns.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the sumMin can be computed as the sum over all possible pairs (a, b) where a is the row-based sum and b is the column-based sum, multiplied by the number of subsets S where A(S) =a and B(S) =b, and multiplied by min(a, b).

But again, the challenge is to compute this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to model the problem using generating functions for A and B and their minimum.

But given time constraints, perhaps it's possible to use the following approach for sumMin:

sumMin = sum_{a=0}^∞ sum_{b=0}^a min(a, b) * f(a, b) = sum_{a=0}^∞ sum_{b=0}^a b * f(a, b) + sum_{a=0}^∞ sum_{b=a+1}^∞ a * f(a, b) 

But this doesn't simplify the problem.

Alternatively, since min(a, b) = a + b - max(a, b), then sumMin = sumA + sumB - sumMax. But sumMax is sumR + sumC - sumMin. So substituting, sumMin = sumA + sumB - (sumR + sumC - sumMin) → 2 sumMin = sumA + sumB - sumR - sumC + sumMin → sumMin = sumA + sumB - sumR - sumC. This seems incorrect, so this line of reasoning is flawed.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll refer to the original code and see if there's a way to compute sumMin correctly.

Looking back, the original code uses a dynamic programming approach where each row contributes to a possible sum of a//2, and then combines these sums. However, this approach only considers the row contributions and not the column contributions.

The correct approach requires tracking both the row and column contributions. However, this is computationally intensive. 

Perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as a bipartite graph, where each row and column is a node, and the points are edges between them. Then, the maximum matching would be related to the maximum bipartite matching. But this is not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the sumMin can be computed using the formula:

sumMin = (sumR + sumC - sumMax) / 2

But how to compute sumMax?

But without further insights, it's challenging to proceed.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute sumR and sumC using the derived formulas and assume that sumMin is zero for the given samples, but this won't work for all cases.

Alternatively, referring to the sample input for 2x2:

sumR = sumC = 8. The total sum is 8 +8 - sumMin = 10 → sumMin =6. So sumMin is 6.

How can this be computed?

For 2x2 grid:

There are 2^4 -1 =15 non-empty subsets.

Each subset contributes min(A, B).

We need to compute the sum of min(A, B) for all 15 subsets.

For example:

Subset with 1 point: A=0, B=0 → min is 0.

Subset with 2 points in same row: A=1, B=0 → min is 0.

Subset with 2 points in same column: A=0, B=1 → min is 0.

Subset with 2 points in different row and column: points (1,1) and (2,2). Then, each row has 1 point (A=0), each column has 1 point (B=0). min is 0.

Subset with 3 points: suppose two in a row and one in another. A=1 (floor(2/2) + floor(1/2) =1+0=1. B: columns may have 2 and 1. For example, three points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Then:

Row 1 has 2 → 1, row 2 has 1 →0. A=1.

Columns: column 1 has 2 →1, column 2 has 1 →0. B=1. min is 1.

So this subset contributes 1.

Other 3-point subsets would have varying contributions.

The 4-point subset: A=2 (1+1), B=2 (1+1). min is 2.

So sumMin is the sum of min(A,B) for all 15 subsets.

But manually computing this for 2x2 would take time, but perhaps it's possible to find a pattern.

But given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to refer to the original code and adjust it to pass the sample cases. However, the original code has a placeholder for sumMin which is incorrect.

Given that the sample input for 2x2 requires sumMin=6, and the code's current placeholder sets sumMin = sumR + sumC mod MOD, which is 16, leading to 16 - 16 =0, which is incorrect.

Thus, the placeholder approach is wrong.

Alternative Idea: sumMin is zero when n=1 or m=1. For other cases, sumMin is equal to the sum of the minimum of the row and column contributions for all subsets. For larger grids, this requires a more sophisticated approach.

But given time constraints and the problem's complexity, perhaps the correct solution is to note that sumMin = 0 when min(n,m) == 1. For other cases, sumMin can be computed using a dynamic programming approach that tracks the possible contributions of rows and columns.

However, without a clear method to compute sumMin, it's difficult to proceed. Given that this part is the crux of the problem and the time constraints, I'll have to look for a different approach or seek inspiration from combinatorial mathematics.

An alternative approach to compute sumMin:

For each subset S, min(A(S), B(S)) can be expressed as the sum over all possible values k of the minimum between the row sum and column sum. But this is not helpful.

Another Idea: The sumMin can be expressed as the sum over all possible pairs (k, l) of the minimum of k and l multiplied by the number of subsets where the row sum is k and column sum is l.

But again, the challenge is to compute this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to model the problem using generating functions where each row contributes to the row sum and each column contributes to the column sum. For example:

The generating function for row contributions is a polynomial where the coefficient of x^k is the sum of the number of ways to choose points in rows such that the row sum is k. Similarly for column contributions.

But since the points are shared between rows and columns, the generating functions for rows and columns are not independent.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Given the time constraints and the difficulty of this problem, I'm unable to derive the correct approach for sumMin. However, referring to the sample input for 2x2:

The sumMin is 6. Let's see how this is achieved.

The sum over all subsets:

- Subsets with 1 point: 4 subsets → min 0 each → total 0.

- Subsets with 2 points:

  - 2 points in same row: 2 rows, C(2,2) =1 each → 2 subsets → min 0 each → total 0.

  - 2 points in same column: 2 columns, C(2,2)=1 each → 2 subsets → min 0 each → total 0.

  - 2 points in different row and column (e.g., (1,1) and (2,2)): 2 such subsets → min 0 each → total 0.

- Subsets with 3 points: 4 subsets.

For example, if the subset includes three points, like two in a row and one elsewhere:

A = 1 (row1 has 2 points) +0 (row2 has 1) =1.

B = 1 (column1 has 2 points) +0 (column2 has 1) =1.

min is 1. There are 4 such subsets (each missing one point). Each contributes 1 → total 4 *1 =4.

- Subset with 4 points: A=2, B=2 → min 2 → contributes 2.

So total sumMin is 0 (from 1 and 2 points) +4 +2=6. Which matches the sample.

So the sumMin for 2x2 is 6.

Thus, the correct approach must account for these contributions.

But how to compute this for general n and m?

Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when a subset has points such that for each row and column, the number of points is even, then A and B are maximized and their minimum is large. But this is vague.

Another Idea: sumMin can be computed as the sum over all subsets S of the minimum of the row sum and column sum. Since row sum and column sum are additive over rows and columns, perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming that tracks both sums.

The DP state can track the current sum of A and B, and the number of ways to achieve that sum.

For each row and column, we compute how their selection of points affects the sums.

For example, when adding a row i, we can choose any number of points in it, which contributes floor(k_i/2) to A. Similarly for each column j.

But the problem is that selecting points in a row affects the column counts, and vice versa.

Thus, this interdependency makes it challenging to model.

An alternative approach is to separate the selection of points into rows and columns, but this is not possible.

Given the time constraints and the complexity of the problem, I'll proceed with the code that correctly computes sumR and sumC, and sets sumMin to zero for the cases where it's correct, but I'm aware that this is not the complete solution. However, for the purpose of passing the sample inputs, this approach may not be sufficient.

Thus, the correct code must include a way to compute sumMin, which is the most challenging part. Unfortunately, without further insights, I'm unable to derive the correct method here. However, based on the initial code and some research, the correct approach involves generating functions and dynamic programming to track the possible sums of A and B.

The code provided here is a placeholder and does not correctly compute sumMin, but it's a starting point. The correct solution requires further analysis and optimization beyond the current scope.
