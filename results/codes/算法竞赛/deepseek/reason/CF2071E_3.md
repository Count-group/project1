Okay, let me try to figure out what's wrong here. The problem requires calculating the expected number of unordered pairs of leaves in a forest after some vertices fall. The initial approach considered adjacent pairs and adjusted for their dependencies. But the sample outputs aren't passing, so there must be something missing.

Wait, in the original code, when two leaves are connected through a common vertex that has fallen, maybe those cases aren't being handled. For example, if two nodes u and v are not adjacent but both connected to a node w that has fallen. In that scenario, u and v might become leaves if they each lose their connection to w and have exactly one other neighbor each. But the initial code might not account for this.

Let me think about the example given in the note. The second test case has three nodes in a chain. When the middle node falls, the two ends become leaves if they are present, but their leaves status depends on their own neighbors. Wait, no, if the middle node falls, the ends are isolated. But a leaf must have exactly one neighbor. So isolated nodes aren't leaves. So that scenario doesn't contribute. Hmm.

Wait, in the note's example, when all three nodes are present, there are no leaves. But when the middle node falls, the other two are isolated and not leaves. So the cases where the middle node is present but others fall. Wait, the note's explanation says that in certain configurations, pairs are considered. Oh right, the correct cases are when exactly one of the nodes is missing, leading to the other two being connected through the middle. For example, if node 1 is missing, nodes 2 and 3 are leaves? No. Wait, in the sample explanation, when node 1 is present, node 2 is present, and node 3 is present, the leaves are 1 and 3 (if the middle node 2 is present). But if node 2 falls, then nodes 1 and 3 are isolated, which have zero edges, so they are not leaves. So the pairs in the sample explanation must be when node 2 is present but the others are not. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.

The key is that when a node falls, it is removed. The remaining nodes form a forest. For a node to be a leaf in the forest, it must have exactly one neighbor in the remaining forest. So in the second test case's sample explanation, when all three nodes are present, each node has two neighbors. So none are leaves. But in the three scenarios where one node is missing:

- If node 1 falls: The remaining tree is 2-3. Node 2 has one neighbor (3), node 3 has one neighbor (2). So both are leaves. So the pair (2,3) contributes.

- If node 2 falls: The remaining trees are 1 and 3. Each is isolated, so they have zero neighbors. Not leaves. So no contribution.

- If node 3 falls: Remaining tree is 1-2. Both are leaves. Pair (1,2) contributes.

Wait, but in the sample explanation's description, the three cases are when exactly one node is present, but that doesn't align. Wait, the sample's note says that in the second test case, each scenario where exactly two nodes are present (like 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.) contributes. But according to the problem statement, the probability of each vertex falling is (p_i/q_i), so staying present is (1 - p_i/q_i). But the code must compute the probability that two nodes are leaves, i.e., each has exactly one neighbor present.

So the code's current approach is to compute for each node u the probability that u is a leaf, then sum over all pairs (u, v) the product of their probabilities, then subtract the cases where they are adjacent. But this approach might miss some cases where u and v are not adjacent but their status as leaves depends on the presence or absence of other nodes.

Wait, but in the linearity of expectation, the expectation of the sum over all pairs is the sum over all pairs of the expectation that both are leaves. So E[sum_{u < v} X_{u,v}] = sum_{u < v} E[X_{u,v}], where X_{u,v} is 1 if both are leaves and 0 otherwise. So the correct approach is to compute for each pair (u, v) the probability that both are leaves, then sum all these probabilities.

But the original code computes (sum L_u)^2 - sum L_u^2 / 2, which is the same as sum_{u < v} L_u L_v. Then subtracts the cases where u and v are adjacent, and adds the correct probability for adjacent pairs. However, this approach works only if the events of u and v being leaves are independent, which they are not. Because the status of u being a leaf depends on the status of its neighbors, which might include v. So the initial approach of using L_u * L_v for non-adjacent pairs is incorrect.

Ah, this is the crux of the problem. The original code assumes independence between u and v being leaves, but in reality, their statuses are dependent, especially when they share a common neighbor.

So the mistake is in the way non-adjacent pairs are handled. For non-adjacent pairs, the events of u and v being leaves are not independent. Therefore, the code's approach of using sum_L squared and subtracting sum_L_sq is incorrect, because it's only valid when all pairs are independent, which they are not.

Thus, the correct approach is to compute for every possible pair (u, v) the probability that both are leaves. For adjacent pairs, their being leaves depends on each other's presence and the presence of their other neighbors. For non-adjacent pairs, they might share a common neighbor whose presence affects both.

But computing this for every pair is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5. So the original approach must have a different way, perhaps handling certain cases efficiently.

Wait, but how can we compute this efficiently?

Alternatively, perhaps the original code is missing the case where u and v are not adjacent but are leaves due to a common neighbor. For example, u and v are both connected to a node w. If w falls, then u and v's status as leaves depends on their other neighbors.

Wait, but if u and v are not adjacent and have no common neighbors, then their statuses are independent. If they share a common neighbor, then their statuses may be dependent.

So the problem is that the original code is not considering the dependency between u and v when they are non-adjacent but share a common neighbor. For example, if u and v are connected through a third node w. The presence or absence of w affects the possibility that u and v are leaves.

But how to model this?

Hmm. Let's think of when u and v are both leaves. For u to be a leaf, exactly one of its neighbors must remain. Similarly for v. For u and v to both be leaves, their respective neighbor conditions must be satisfied.

So for a pair (u, v), the probability that both are leaves is the sum over all possible subsets S of the remaining vertices (excluding u and v) where in the resulting forest, u and v are leaves.

But this is computationally impossible. So the code must find a way to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the probability that u is a leaf and v is a leaf as the product of their individual probabilities minus the cases where their events are not independent. But this seems complex.

Wait, perhaps the original code's approach is correct for pairs that are not adjacent and have no common neighbors. But for pairs that are not adjacent but share a common neighbor, their probabilities are not independent.

So the code's initial approach of using (sum_L)^2 - sum_L^2 / 2 and then subtracting adjacent terms is incorrect for pairs that share a common neighbor. But how to account for that?

But how many such pairs are there? For a tree, the number of such pairs is O(n), since each node can have O(1) common neighbors. Wait, in a tree, two non-adjacent nodes can have at most one common neighbor. Because in a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path between them. So if u and v are not adjacent, their path must have at least two edges. So their common ancestor (the node where their paths diverge) is their least common ancestor. But perhaps in this case, u and v share a common neighbor only if they are siblings (i.e., connected through their parent). Wait, no. For example, if u is connected to w, and w is connected to x, and x is connected to v. Then u and v are not adjacent and share no common neighbor. So pairs of non-adjacent nodes in a tree do not have any common neighbors. Wait, no, that's only true if they are siblings. For example, in a star-shaped tree (one central node connected to all others), any two leaves are connected through the central node and share it as a common neighbor.

Ah! So in a star-shaped tree, any two leaves are non-adjacent but share a common neighbor (the center). So for these pairs, their status as leaves is not independent. The original code's approach would incorrectly compute their probabilities as L_u * L_v, but in reality, their joint probability depends on the state of the center node.

So this is the missing case in the original code. The code didn't account for pairs of non-adjacent nodes that share a common neighbor. For such pairs, their probability of both being leaves is not the product of their individual probabilities.

So the problem with the original code is that it's missing the correction for these pairs. Thus, the code needs to compute for all pairs (u, v) that are not adjacent but share a common neighbor, and adjust their joint probability.

But how to compute this efficiently?

For a tree, each pair of nodes that are not adjacent and share a common neighbor must be such that their paths go through that common neighbor. For example, in a star-shaped tree, all pairs of leaves share the center as a common neighbor.

So, for each such pair (u, v), the joint probability that both are leaves is the probability that:

1. u is present (probability a[u]).

2. v is present (probability a[v]).

3. The common neighbor w is present.

4. All other neighbors of u except w are absent.

5. All other neighbors of v except w are absent.

6. All other neighbors of w except u and v are absent.

But wait, in this case, u and v are leaves only if:

- u has exactly one neighbor (w) present. So all neighbors of u except w must be absent, and w must be present.

Similarly for v: all neighbors of v except w must be absent, and w must be present.

And for w: all neighbors except u and v must be absent. Because if w is present and has exactly two neighbors (u and v), then w is not a leaf. But in this scenario, u's other neighbors (if any) must be absent. Similarly for v.

So for such a pair (u, v) connected through a common w, the probability that both u and v are leaves is:

a[u] * a[v] * a[w] * (product of (1 - a[x]) for x in neighbors of u, x != w) * (product of (1 - a[y]) for y in neighbors of v, x != w) * (product of (1 - a[z]) for z in neighbors of w, z != u and z != v).

So for each such triplet (u, v, w), where u and v are both connected to w, and u and v are not adjacent, we need to compute this probability and add it to the total.

The original code's approach missed this part. Therefore, the code needs to iterate over all such triplets and account for these contributions.

But how to find all such triplets (u, v, w) where u and v are not adjacent but share w as a common neighbor?

For each node w, iterate over all pairs of its children (u, v) that are not adjacent. Then for each such pair (u, v), compute the contribution as described.

In a tree, the number of such triplets is O(n) because each node w has O(1) children. Wait, no. For a star-shaped tree with k leaves, the number of pairs of leaves is O(k²), which is O(n²) when k is O(n). So this would be O(n²) in the worst case, which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.

But in the problem constraints, n can be up to 1e5, and the code must handle that. So an O(n²) approach is impossible. Hence, there must be a smarter way to compute this contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code's approach was correct except for adjacent pairs, but when the code was modified to account for the adjacent pairs, it's still missing some other cases. Or maybe there's a mistake in the way the product is computed for the leaves.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code's calculation of L[u] is incorrect.

Let me re-examine how L[u] is computed.

L[u] is the probability that u is a leaf. For u to be a leaf, u must be present (probability a[u]), and exactly one of its neighbors must be present.

The code computes S_u as the sum over all neighbors v of (probability that v is present) multiplied by the product of (1 - a[x]) for all other neighbors of u except v.

But wait, the formula for S_u is sum_{v ∈ neighbors} [ a[v]/(1 - a[v}) ] * product_{x ∈ neighbors} (1 - a[x}) } / (1 - a[v})?

Wait, the code does:

For each neighbor v of u:

term = (1 - a[v]) → which is the probability that v is absent. Wait, no. Because (1 - a[v]) is the probability that v is present. Wait, a[v] is the probability that v remains (since a[v] = (q_i - p_i)/q_i). Wait, no. Wait, in the code:

p_i is the probability that the vertex falls. So the probability that the vertex remains is (q_i - p_i)/q_i. So a[v] = (q_i - p_i)/q_i. So (1 - a[v}) would be (p_i)/q_i, which is the probability that the vertex falls. So when the code computes term = (1 - a[v}) mod MOD, that's the probability that v is absent.

But for S_u, which is the probability that exactly one neighbor of u is present (since u is a leaf), S_u should be the sum over all neighbors v of [ (probability that v is present) * product over all other neighbors x of u (probability that x is absent) ].

So for each neighbor v of u, the contribution is a[v] * product_{x in neighbors(u), x != v} (1 - a[x}).

But the code computes sum_terms as sum over neighbors of a[v] * inv_1_minus_a[v]. Then multiplies by p_all, which is product over all neighbors of (1 - a[v}).

So let's see:

p_all = product_{x in neighbors} (1 - a[x}).

sum_terms = sum_{v in neighbors} a[v} / (1 - a[v}).

Because inv_1_minus_a[v} = 1 / (1 - a[v}) mod MOD.

Then S_u = p_all * sum_terms.

But p_all is product (1 - a[x} ), sum_terms is sum (a[v}/(1 - a[v})).

Multiplying these gives sum (a[v} * product_{x != v} (1 - a[x} )).

Which is exactly the required sum for S_u. So S_u is the probability that exactly one neighbor of u is present (given that u is present).

Therefore, L[u] = a[u] * S_u is the correct probability that u is a leaf.

So the calculation of L[u] is correct.

Then, the code computes the total as sum_L * sum_L - sum_L_sq / 2, which is sum_{u < v} L[u] * L[v}. This would be correct if all pairs are independent, but in reality, adjacent pairs and pairs sharing a common neighbor are not independent.

But the code subtracts the contribution of adjacent pairs (which are counted in L[u] * L[v} but are not independent) and replaces them with the correct probability.

But the problem is pairs that are not adjacent but share a common neighbor. For these pairs, L[u] * L[v} is not the correct probability, so the initial code's approach would include these terms, which are incorrect.

Therefore, the code is missing contributions from pairs of non-adjacent nodes that share a common neighbor. These pairs are being accounted for as L[u] * L[v} but their actual probability is different.

So the solution is to compute for all such pairs (u, v) that are not adjacent but share a common neighbor w, and adjust their contribution.

But how to do this efficiently?

For each node w, we can look at all pairs of its neighbors (u, v) that are not adjacent. For each such pair, compute the probability that u and v are both leaves, and w is present, and add this to the total.

But in a tree, for a node w, any two neighbors u and v are adjacent to w, but not necessarily to each other. So for each such pair (u, v) that are not adjacent, we need to compute the contribution where:

- u is present, and has exactly one neighbor (w) present. So all other neighbors of u must be absent.

- v is present, and has exactly one neighbor (w) present. All other neighbors of v must be absent.

- w is present, and all its neighbors except u and v must be absent.

- Additionally, u and v are not adjacent, so their only connection is through w.

The probability for this scenario is:

a[u] * a[v] * a[w] *

product_{x ∈ neighbors(u), x != w} (1 - a[x}) *

product_{y ∈ neighbors(v), y != w} (1 - a[y}) *

product_{z ∈ neighbors(w), z != u and z != v} (1 - a[z}).

So for each such triplet (u, v, w), where u and v are neighbors of w and not adjacent to each other, this is the contribution to the expected count.

The code must iterate through all such triplets and sum their contributions.

But how to do this efficiently?

For each node w, iterate over all pairs of its neighbors. For each pair (u, v) of neighbors of w, check if u and v are not adjacent. If not, add their contribution.

But checking if u and v are adjacent is O(1) using a set or a hash map. The code can pre-process all edges into a set for quick look-up.

So steps:

1. Preprocess all edges into a set for O(1) adjacency checks.

2. For each node w:

   a. Iterate over all pairs (u, v) of its neighbors where u < v.

   b. For each pair, check if (u, v) is an edge. If not, compute the contribution and add it to the total.

So the number of such pairs is, for each node w, O(k choose 2), where k is the number of children of w. For a tree, this can be O(n^2) in the worst case (like a star-shaped tree with n-1 leaves, leading to O(n^2) pairs). But for n up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

So the code needs to find a way to compute this without iterating through all O(k^2) pairs.

Wait, but maybe in the sample input, the code is passing in the first test case but not in others. For example, the second test case is a chain of three nodes. Node 2 has neighbors 1 and 3. Nodes 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So this pair (1,3) is processed here. Their contribution is when node 2 is present, node 1 and 3 are leaves. But in the code's initial approach, the contribution for pair (1,3) would have been L[1] * L[3}, which is incorrect.

In the sample's second test case:

The original code computes the initial total as (L1 + L2 + L3)^2 - (L1^2 + L2^2 + L3^2) ) / 2. Then subtracts the adjacent pairs (1,2) and (2,3) contributions and adds their correct probabilities. But pair (1,3) is not adjacent and not handled. However, according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 3/8, but according to the code's approach, let's see:

Each node's L is:

For node 1: a[1] = (2-1)/2 = 1/2. Its only neighbor is 2. So S_1 is the sum over neighbors of a[v}/(1 - a[v}) * product (1 - a[x}).

But neighbor is 2. a[2} = (2-1)/2 = 1/2. So product (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors is (1 - a[2}) = 1/2. sum_terms is a[2}/(1 - a[2}) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1. So S_1 = (1/2) * 1 = 1/2. So L[1} = a[1} * S_1 = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly for node 3, L[3} is 1/4.

Node 2 has neighbors 1 and 3. S_2 is sum over v in {1,3} of (a[v}/(1 - a[v}) ) * product (1 - a[x}).

For v=1: a[v}/(1 - a[v}) = (1/2)/(1 - 1/2) ) = 1.

product (1 - a[x} for x !=1) is (1 - a[3}) = 1/2.

Similarly for v=3: same as v=1.

sum_terms = 1 * (1/2) + 1 * (1/2) = 1.

S_2 = product (1 - a[x}) for all neighbors (1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4) multiplied by sum_terms (1) → 1/4 * 1 = 1/4. L[2} = a[2} * S_2 = 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8.

So sum_L = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/4 = 5/8.

sum_L squared is 25/64. sum_L_sq is 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/16 = (4 + 1 +4)/64 = 9/64. So (25 -9)/64 = 16/64 = 1/4. Divided by 2 gives 1/8. So initial total is 1/8.

Then, adjacent pairs (1,2) and (2,3) are processed. For each pair (u, v):

term1 is L[u} * L[v} = (1/4)(1/8) = 1/32 for (1,2), same for (2,3). For each edge, delta is P_uv - term1. P_uv is the probability that both are leaves and adjacent.

For edge (u, v) = (1,2):

part_u is prod_all[1} * inv_1_minus_a[2} → prod_all[1} is the product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors of 1 (which is 2). So 1 - a[2} is 1/2. inv_1_minus_a[2} is 2. So part_u = (1/2) * 2 = 1.

part_v is prod_all[2} * inv_1_minus_a[1} → prod_all[2} is (1 - a[1}) * (1 - a[3}) = (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/2) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. inv_1_minus_a[1} is 1/(1 - a[1} ) → a[1} = 1/2 → 1 - a[1} is 1/2, inv is 2. So part_v = 1/4 * 2 = 1/2.

P_uv = a[1} * a[2} * part_u * part_v = (1/2) * (1/2) * 1 * 1/2 = 1/8.

term1 is (1/4) * (1/8) = 1/32. delta is 1/8 - 1/32 = 3/32.

So for each edge (1,2) and (2,3), delta is 3/32. Adding two times 3/32 gives 6/32 = 3/16.

So total after edges is 1/8 + 3/16 = 5/16. Which is 5/16 = 0.3125.

But the sample's correct answer is 3/8 = 0.375. So the code's initial approach is missing some contributions. The missing part is the contribution from non-adjacent pairs that share a common neighbor.

In the sample's case, the pair (1,3) shares node 2 as a common neighbor. But since 1 and 3 are not adjacent, the code's initial approach counts their contribution as L[1} * L[3} = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. But the actual probability that both are leaves is zero because for both to be leaves, node 2 must be present. But if node 2 is present, then in the tree, node 1 and 3 are both connected to node 2. So to be leaves, they must each have exactly one neighbor. So node 1 must have node 2 present and no other neighbors (which is true here since node 1 has only one neighbor). Same for node 3. And node 2 must have exactly two neighbors (nodes 1 and 3) present, which would make node 2 not a leaf. So in this case, the scenario where node 1 and 3 are leaves and node 2 is present is valid.

The joint probability for this case is:

a[1} * a[3} * a[2} * product_{x in neighbors(1) except 2} (1 - a[x}) → neighbors(1) are only 2, so product is 1.

Similarly for neighbors(3) except 2, product is 1.

 product_{z in neighbors(2) except 1 and 3} (1 - a[z}) → neighbors(2) are 1 and 3, so product is 1.

So the contribution is a[1} * a[3} * a[2} = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.

This contribution is missing in the code's current approach. So the code needs to add this contribution.

So for each such pair (u, v) that are not adjacent but share a common neighbor w, their contribution is a[u} * a[v} * a[w} multiplied by the product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors(u) except w, product of (1 - a[y}) for y in neighbors(v) except w, and product of (1 - a[z}) for z in neighbors(w) except u and v.

In the sample, this contribution is 1/8. The code's current total after processing edges is 5/16 = 0.3125. Adding this 1/8 gives 5/16 + 1/8 = 5/16 + 2/16 = 7/16 = 0.4375, which is larger than the expected 3/8 (0.375). So there must be a mistake in this reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the scenario where both u and v are leaves and share a common neighbor w is allowed only if w is present and has exactly u and v as neighbors. But in the sample's case, when all three nodes are present, nodes 1 and 3 each have one neighbor (node 2), and node 2 has two neighbors. So nodes 1 and 3 are leaves, node 2 is not. So the pair (1,3) is considered. But the probability for this scenario is when all three are present. But in the sample's explanation, this scenario is not considered because the probability of all three nodes being present is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. But according to the sample explanation, there are three scenarios contributing 1 each with probability 1/8. The sum is 3/8. But according to the code's current approach, the contribution of the pair (1,3) is not handled, leading to the discrepancy.

So the code must compute this contribution and add it to the total.

But how to find all such pairs (u, v) that are not adjacent but share a common neighbor.

In the sample's case, the pair (1,3) is connected through node 2. The code's current approach misses this.

So the solution is to iterate through all pairs of non-adjacent nodes that share a common neighbor and add their contributions.

But how to do this efficiently.

The code must:

1. For each node w, iterate through all pairs of its neighbors u and v.

2. Check if u and v are not adjacent.

3. If so, compute the contribution and add it to the total.

In the sample's case, this would add the contribution for pair (1,3) through node 2.

But in a tree, the number of such pairs can be O(n^2) in the worst case. For example, a star-shaped tree where the center is connected to all other nodes. Then, any pair of leaves shares the center as a common neighbor and are not adjacent. So the number of pairs is (k choose 2) where k is the number of leaves, which can be O(n^2).

Thus, this approach is not feasible for large n.

But the problem allows sum of n across test cases up to 1e5, and per test case n up to 1e5. So an O(n^2) approach is not feasible. Therefore, the code must find a way to compute this contribution in O(n) or O(m) time.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to model this contribution without iterating through all possible pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the contribution for such pairs is zero. But in the sample, this is not the case.

So the code must find a way to compute these contributions efficiently.

Wait, but perhaps this contribution is part of the original code's additional_total loop. Let me check the code's additional_total section.

In the code, after processing the edges, there's a loop for w in 1 to n:

   for each pair of neighbors i and j of w (i < j):

      if (u, v) is not an edge:

          compute contrib and add to additional_total.

But in the code, the way contrib is computed is:

contrib = a[u] * a[v] * a[w] * part_u * part_v * part_w.

part_u is the product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors of u, excluding w.

part_v is the product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors of v, excluding w.

part_w is the product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors of w, excluding u and v.

This is exactly the contribution for the pair (u, v) being leaves via their common neighbor w.

So the code's additional_total loop is supposed to account for all such pairs. But in the code provided in the previous response, this loop is included. But perhaps in the code that was first written, this loop was missing.

Looking at the first code provided by the assistant, there was an additional loop for w in range(1, n+1), which iterates over all pairs of neighbors of w. This loop is intended to account for these contributions. However, perhaps the code's calculation of part_u, part_v, and part_w is incorrect.

In the sample's case:

For w=2, u=1, v=3.

part_u is the product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors of u (which is only w=2) except w. So x is none, product is 1.

part_v is same as part_u.

part_w is product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors of w (1 and 3) except u and v. So x is none, product is 1.

So contrib is a[1} * a[3} * a[2} * 1 * 1 * 1 = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.

This is added to additional_total. So in the code's current approach, additional_total is 1/8 for this case.

The initial total after processing edges was 5/16 (0.3125). Adding additional_total of 1/8 (0.125) gives 5/16 + 2/16 = 7/16 = 0.4375. But the sample's expected answer is 3/8 = 0.375. So there's a discrepancy.

Hmm, this suggests that there's an error in the code's calculation of additional_total.

Wait, in the sample's explanation, the valid cases are when exactly one of the three nodes is missing. For example, when node 1 is missing, the remaining nodes are 2 and 3. Both are leaves. So their contribution is 1. The probability of this case is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8. Similarly for when node 3 is missing, and node 2 is missing. Wait, no, the sample explanation says that the three cases contribute 1 each, but when node 2 is missing, the remaining nodes are 1 and 3, which are isolated and not leaves. So the contributing cases are when node 1 is missing, node 2 is missing, or node 3 is missing. But according to the sample explanation, the three cases are:

- Only node 1 is present? Or when node 1 falls and the other two are present. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the sample.

Sample input's second test case: three nodes in a chain: 1-2-3.

The sample explanation says:

In each of the three cases where exactly one of the three nodes falls, the other two form a pair of leaves. For example, if node 1 falls, nodes 2 and 3 are leaves. If node 2 falls, nodes 1 and 3 are isolated. If node 3 falls, nodes 1 and 2 are leaves.

Wait, but the probability of node 1 falling is p_1/q_1 = 1/2, and the others are present. So the probability for this case is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8. Similarly for the other two cases. So the total is 3 * 1/8 = 3/8.

So the expected answer is 3/8.

But according to the code's approach, the initial total after edges is 5/16, additional_total is 1/8. Sum is 5/16 + 2/16 = 7/16 = 0.4375. Which is 7/16 = 0.4375, which is not equal to 3/8 = 0.375. So the code's calculation is incorrect.

So where is the mistake?

Let's re-calculate all parts.

Initial total after sum_L squared part:

sum_L = L1 + L2 + L3 = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/4 = 5/8.

sum_L squared is (5/8)^2 = 25/64.

sum_L_sq = (1/4)^2 + (1/8)^2 + (1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/16 = (4 + 1 +4)/64 = 9/64.

total = (25/64 -9/64) / 2 = (16/64)/2 = (0.25)/2 = 0.125 → 1/8.

Then, processing edges:

For edge (1,2):

term1 = L1 * L2 = (1/4)(1/8) = 1/32.

part_u = prod_all[1} * inv_1_minus_a[2}.

prod_all[1} is product of (1 - a[x}) for x in neighbors of 1 (which is 2). (1 - a[2}) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

inv_1_minus_a[2} is 1/(1 - a[2}) = 2. So part_u = (1/2) * 2 = 1.

part_v is prod_all[2} * inv_1_minus_a[1}.

prod_all[2} is product of (1 - a[1}) and (1 - a[3}) → (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

inv_1_minus_a[1} is 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2. So part_v = 1/4 * 2 = 1/2.

P_uv = a[1} * a[2} * part_u * part_v = (1/2)(1/2) * 1 * (1/2) = 1/8.

delta = P_uv - term1 = 1/8 - 1/32 = 3/32.

Similarly for edge (2,3), delta is 3/32.

Total after edges: 1/8 + 3/32 + 3/32 = 1/8 + 6/32 = 1/8 + 3/16 = 5/16.

Then, additional_total is 1/8.

So total becomes 5/16 + 1/8 = 5/16 + 2/16 = 7/16.

But expected is 3/8 = 6/16. So there's an extra 1/16.

What's the source of this discrepancy?

Ah! The additional_total loop is adding contributions that shouldn't be there. Because in the scenario where all three nodes are present, nodes 1 and 3 are leaves and node 2 is present. This scenario is part of the code's additional_total contribution. However, according to the problem statement, the pair (1,3) is counted as a valid pair of leaves in this scenario. But according to the problem's definition, a leaf is a node with exactly one neighbor in the forest. In this scenario, node 1 is connected to node 2, which is present. Node 3 is connected to node 2, which is present. Node 2 is connected to both, so it has two neighbors and is not a leaf. So nodes 1 and 3 are leaves. So this pair (1,3) is indeed valid and should be counted.

But according to the sample explanation, the three cases that contribute are when exactly one node falls. But when all three nodes are present, the pair (1,3) is also a valid pair of leaves. But in the sample's explanation, this scenario is not considered. Why?

Wait, the sample explanation says:

The three cases have a probability of (1/2)^3 each. But the cases are:

- All nodes except 1 are present: nodes 2 and 3 are leaves.

- All nodes except 3 are present: nodes 1 and 2 are leaves.

- All nodes except 2 are present: nodes 1 and 3 are not leaves (they are isolated).

Wait, no. If node 2 falls, then the remaining nodes are 1 and 3, which are not connected. So each has zero neighbors. Thus, they are not leaves. So the three valid cases are when node 1 falls (nodes 2 and 3 are leaves), node 3 falls (nodes 1 and 2 are leaves), and node 2 falls (no contribution). But according to the sample explanation, the three cases are when exactly one node falls. But in the sample explanation, the three contributing cases are when one node falls and the others are present. Wait, but when node 2 falls, the other two are present but not leaves. So the three cases are:

- node 1 falls (others present): 2 and 3 are leaves.

- node 2 falls (others present): 1 and 3 are not leaves.

- node 3 falls (others present): 1 and 2 are leaves.

So two of the three cases contribute. But according to the sample explanation, all three cases contribute. This suggests a confusion in the initial analysis.

Wait, the sample explanation says:

The answer is 3/8, derived from three cases each contributing 1/8. This implies that in each of the three scenarios where exactly one node falls, the pair is counted. But according to the actual scenario, when node 2 falls, the other two are isolated and not leaves. So why does the sample explanation say that all three cases contribute?

Ah, the sample explanation must have a mistake. Or perhaps the problem statement has a different interpretation.

Wait, the problem statement says:

"In the second test case, vertices that have not fallen are denoted in bold. Let us examine the following three cases:

In each case, one vertex has fallen, and the other two remain."

So in each case, exactly one vertex has fallen. The sample explanation's three cases are:

1. Vertex 1 has fallen. So vertices 2 and 3 are present. The tree becomes 2-3. Both are leaves. So pair (2,3).

2. Vertex 3 has fallen. So vertices 1 and 2 are present. The tree becomes 1-2. Both are leaves. Pair (1,2).

3. Vertex 2 has fallen. So vertices 1 and 3 are present. They are isolated. Not leaves. But according to the sample explanation, this case contributes pair (1,3). But that's not possible.

So there's a discrepancy here. How does the sample explanation arrive at three cases each contributing 1/8?

Ah, perhaps the sample explanation's description is incorrect. Or perhaps the original problem statement's sample explanation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is considering cases where two nodes are present and form a pair of leaves. For example:

When vertex 1 is present, vertex 2 is present, and vertex 3 has fallen, the pair (1,2) is considered. Similarly for other cases.

But this is when exactly one node has fallen, leading to a pair of leaves. So the three cases are:

- node 3 falls: leaves are 1 and 2.

- node 1 falls: leaves are 2 and 3.

- node 2 falls: leaves are 1 and 3 (but they are isolated, so not leaves).

But according to this, only two cases contribute. So why is the sample answer 3/8?

Ah, perhaps the sample explanation has a mistake. Or perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.

But according to the code's calculation, when all three nodes are present, nodes 1 and 3 are leaves. This scenario's probability is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. So the pair (1,3) contributes 1/8. The three cases from the sample explanation contribute 1/8 each (3/8), and the scenario where all three are present contributes 1/8. So the total is 4/8 = 0.5. But the code's current calculation is 7/16 = 0.4375.

But this doesn't align with the sample's expected answer. So there must be a mistake in the code's logic.

Perhaps the code is adding the contribution of the scenario where all three nodes are present (pair (1,3)) via the additional_total loop, but according to the problem statement, this scenario is valid and should be counted. But according to the sample explanation, this scenario is not considered. However, the sample's expected answer is 3/8, which suggests that the code is missing some contributions.

This suggests that the code's approach is not correctly capturing all possible pairs of leaves.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's additional_total loop is adding the contribution of pairs (u, v) that are connected through a common neighbor, even if they are adjacent. But in the case where u and v are adjacent, they are handled in the edges loop. So the additional_total loop should only process pairs (u, v) that are not adjacent.

But in the code's additional_total loop, for each w, it iterates over all pairs of neighbors (u, v) of w, checks if they are not adjacent, and then computes their contribution.

In the sample's case, nodes 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So their contribution is added via the additional_total loop. So in the code's calculation, the pair (1,3) contributes 1/8. The three cases in the sample explanation contribute 3/8, and the code's additional 1/8 brings the total to 4/8, which is 0.5, but the sample expects 3/8.

This indicates that the code is overcounting.

But according to the problem's sample explanation, the correct answer is 3/8. So the code's current approach is incorrect.

So what is the correct way to model this scenario?

The problem is that the code's additional_total loop is counting the scenario where all three nodes are present (1, 2, 3) as a contributing pair (1,3). But according to the problem statement, when all three are present, nodes 1 and 3 are leaves, and thus their pair is counted. So the expected answer should include this scenario.

But according to the sample explanation, it's not included, which suggests a discrepancy.

But according to the problem statement, the sample's expected answer is 3/8. So the code must produce 3/8.

But according to the code's current approach, it's 7/16 = 0.4375. So something is wrong.

Ah! The mistake is in the code's additional_total loop. It's adding the contribution for the scenario where nodes u, v, and w are all present. But according to the problem's definition, for u and v to be leaves, they must each have exactly one neighbor present. So in the case where u and v are connected to w, and all three are present:

- u has exactly one neighbor (w), so u is a leaf.

- v has exactly one neighbor (w), so v is a leaf.

- w has two neighbors (u and v), so w is not a leaf.

Thus, this scenario is valid and should contribute to the pair (u, v).

But according to the code's additional_total loop, the contribution for this scenario is a[u] * a[v] * a[w} multiplied by the products of (1 - a[x}) for other neighbors of u, v, and w.

But when all three are present, this is correct. The code's additional_total loop is adding this contribution, but according to the sample explanation, this scenario is not considered. So the sample explanation is incorrect, or the code is missing other considerations.

But according to the problem statement, the expected answer in the sample is 3/8, which is achieved by the three scenarios where exactly one node falls. So the code must not include the scenario where all three are present.

But according to the problem's definition, this scenario should be included. So the sample explanation must be incorrect.

But how to reconcile this?

This suggests that there's a mistake in the code's logic. Perhaps the code is incorrectly counting the scenario where all three nodes are present as a valid pair of leaves. But according to the problem's definition, it is valid.

So why does the sample's expected answer not include this contribution?

This suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect, and the correct answer is indeed 4/8 = 0.5, which is 1/2. But according to the sample, the expected output is 623902721, which is the modular inverse of 8/3. 3/8 mod 998244353 is 3 * 124780544 = 374341632 mod 998244353. Wait, no. Wait, 3/8 mod 998244353 is 3 * inv(8) mod MOD. inv(8) is 124780544. So 3 * 124780544 = 374341632. But the sample's output is 623902721, which is 3/8 mod 998244353. Because 623902721 * 8 mod MOD is 3: 623902721 *8 = 4991221768. 4991221768 mod 998244353 is 4991221768 - 5*998244353 = 4991221768-4991221765=3. So yes, 623902721 is 3/8 mod MOD.

So according to the sample's explanation, the answer is 3/8. But according to the code's approach, it's 7/16. This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

So where is the error?

Perhaps the code's additional_total loop is adding contributions that should not be there. For example, in the scenario where all three nodes are present, the pair (1,3) is counted, but according to the problem statement, this is a valid pair of leaves, so it should be counted. But according to the sample explanation, it's not considered, implying that the code's approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, the code's additional_total loop is adding contributions for pairs (u, v) that are connected through w and are leaves, but the original code's initial approach (sum_L squared) already counts these pairs as L[u] * L[v}, which is incorrect. Thus, the code's additional_total loop is adding the correct contribution and subtracting the incorrect L[u] * L[v} contribution.

But in the code's current approach, the initial sum_L squared includes L[u] * L[v} for all pairs (u, v), including those that share a common neighbor. Then, for edges, the code subtracts L[u] * L[v} and adds the correct contribution. For pairs sharing a common neighbor, the code adds the correct contribution but does not subtract the initial L[u] * L[v} term. So these pairs are counted twice: once in the initial sum_L squared, and once in the additional_total loop. This would lead to overcounting.

Ah! This is the mistake. The code's initial sum_L squared includes all pairs (u, v), including those that share a common neighbor. The code then adds the correct contribution for these pairs via the additional_total loop, but does not subtract the initial incorrect L[u] * L[v} term. Thus, the code is double-counting these pairs.

In the sample's case, the pair (1,3) is part of the initial sum_L squared (contributing (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16), and then the additional_total loop adds 1/8. So the total contribution for this pair is 1/16 + 1/8 = 3/16. But the correct contribution is 1/8. So the code is adding 1/16 + 1/8 = 3/16 for this pair, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code must subtract the initial L[u] * L[v} term for pairs (u, v) that share a common neighbor and are not adjacent.

But how to do this efficiently.

The code's current approach is:

total = sum_L choose 2 (sum of L[u] * L[v} for all u < v)

Then subtract for adjacent pairs (L[u} * L[v} - correct_probability)

For pairs that share a common neighbor and are not adjacent, their initial contribution is L[u} * L[v}, which is incorrect. The code must subtract this term and add the correct contribution.

But how to find all such pairs.

This is not feasible for large n.

Thus, the code's current approach is incorrect, and the problem requires a different approach.

Alternative approach:

Instead of using the linearity of expectation over pairs, compute for each node the probability of being a leaf, and then for each pair, compute the correct probability of both being leaves.

But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Another approach is to note that for any pair (u, v), the probability that both are leaves is:

If u and v are adjacent: P(u is leaf and v is leaf and they are connected).

If u and v are not adjacent: P(u is leaf) * P(v is leaf) - covariance.

But computing the covariance for all non-adjacent pairs is not feasible.

Thus, the correct approach must model the expected value as the sum over all possible pairs of the probability that both are leaves.

This can be done by considering three cases for each pair (u, v):

1. u and v are adjacent.

2. u and v are not adjacent but share a common neighbor.

3. u and v are not adjacent and do not share a common neighbor.

For case 3, the probability that both are leaves is indeed L[u} * L[v}.

For case 1, the probability is different and must be computed as in the code's edge processing.

For case 2, the probability must be computed as in the code's additional_total loop.

But how to compute case 2 pairs efficiently.

The problem is that the code's current approach does not subtract the initial L[u} * L[v} contribution for case 2 pairs. So the code adds the correct contribution for case 2 pairs but leaves the initial term, leading to overcounting.

Thus, the code must:

- For all pairs (u, v) that are not adjacent and share a common neighbor, subtract L[u} * L[v} from the total and add the correct contribution.

But how to find these pairs.

This seems challenging, but given the constraints of the problem, perhaps the code can iterate through all pairs of nodes (u, v) that share a common neighbor and are not adjacent, and subtract L[u} * L[v} and add the correct contribution.

But with n up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

Thus, the correct approach must find a way to compute the expected value without explicitly iterating over all such pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can compute the expected value as follows:

E = sum_{u} L[u} choose 2} + sum_{edges} (P_adjacent_pair) - sum_{non-adjacent pairs with common neighbor} (L[u} * L[v} - P_non_adjacent_pair) 

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can compute the expected value as:

E = sum_{u < v} [ probability that both u and v are leaves ]

This can be decomposed into:

sum_{u < v} [ probability u and v are leaves and adjacent ] + sum_{u < v} [ probability u and v are leaves and not adjacent ]

For adjacent pairs, the code computes the correct probability as part of the edge processing. For non-adjacent pairs, if they do not share a common neighbor, the probability is L[u} * L[v}. If they do share a common neighbor, the probability is computed in the additional_total loop. But this requires iterating over all such pairs.

But again, this is not feasible for large n.

Thus, the code must find a way to compute these contributions efficiently.

But given the time constraints, the correct approach is likely to compute:

E = sum_{u < v} (L[u} * L[v} ) + sum_{edges} (P_adjacent_pair - L[u} * L[v} ) + sum_{non-adjacent pairs with common neighbor} (P_non_adjacent_pair - L[u} * L[v} )

But how to compute the third term.

The third term is the sum over all non-adjacent pairs with common neighbor of (P_non_adjacent_pair - L[u} * L[v} ).

This can be computed by iterating over all triplets (u, v, w) where u and v are neighbors of w, u < v, and u and v are not adjacent. For each such triplet, compute (P_non_adjacent_pair - L[u} * L[v} ) and add it to the total.

In the sample's case, this would be:

P_non_adjacent_pair = 1/8

L[u} * L[v} = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16

So contribution is 1/8 - 1/16 = 1/16.

Thus, adding this to the total.

So the code's additional_total loop must compute this difference for each triplet and add it to the total.

In the previous code version, the additional_total loop was adding P_non_adjacent_pair but not subtracting L[u} * L[v} . This led to overcounting.

Thus, the correct code must compute for each such triplet (u, v, w) the delta (P_uv - L[u} * L[v} ), and add this delta to the total.

But the code's additional_total loop currently adds P_uv, but the initial sum_L squared already includes L[u} * L[v} . So the delta is P_uv - L[u} * L[v} .

Thus, the code must compute this delta and add it to the total.

In the sample's case, this would contribute 1/16 per triplet (u, v, w), and the triplet count is 1. So total delta is 1/16. Adding this to the previous total of 5/16 + 1/16 = 6/16 = 3/8, which matches the sample's expected answer.

Thus, the code's additional_total loop must compute this delta and add it, not just the P_uv.

So the code's additional_total loop should compute:

contrib = P_uv - (L[u} * L[v} )

And add this contrib to the total.

Thus, the code's additional_total loop should be modified from:

additional_total = (additional_total + contrib) % MOD

To:

delta = (contrib - L[u} * L[v} ) % MOD

additional_total = (additional_total + delta) % MOD

Thus, for each non-adjacent pair (u, v) sharing a common neighbor, the code subtracts L[u} * L[v} and adds P_uv.

This way, the initial sum_L squared term includes L[u} * L[v} , and the code adds the delta (P_uv - L[u} * L[v} ), leading to the correct total.

So the code's additional_total loop should compute the delta between the correct contribution and the initial L[u} * L[v} term.

In the sample's case, this delta is 1/8 - 1/16 = 1/16, leading to the correct total.

Thus, the code's missing part is subtracting L[u} * L[v} from the contribution of non-adjacent pairs with common neighbors.

So the code must be modified to:

for each pair (u, v) of neighbors of w not adjacent:

    compute contrib = a[u} * a[v} * a[w} * ... 

    term = L[u} * L[v}

    delta = (contrib - term) % MOD

    additional_total = (additional_total + delta) % MOD

Thus, the correct code would have this delta.

So, putting this together, the code's additional_total loop should be:

additional_total = 0

for w in 1 to n:

    neighbors = adj[w]

    for i in range(len(neighbors)):

        for j in range(i+1, len(neighbors)):

            u = neighbors[i]

            v = neighbors[j]

            if (u, v) not in edges_set:

                # compute contrib

                part_u = product of (1 - a[x}) for x in adj[u} if x !=w

                part_v = product of (1 - a[y}) for y in adj[v} if y !=w

                part_w = product of (1 - a[z}) for z in adj[w} if z not in {u, v}

                contrib = a[u} * a[v} * a[w} * part_u * part_v * part_w % MOD

                term = (L[u} * L[v}) % MOD

                delta = (contrib - term) % MOD

                additional_total = (additional_total + delta) % MOD

Thus, the code's additional_total loop computes the difference between the correct contribution and the initial L[u} * L[v} term, and adds this delta to the total.

In the sample's case, this delta is 1/8 - 1/16 = 1/16. Adding this to the previous total of 5/16 (from edges processing) gives 5/16 + 1/16 = 6/16 = 3/8, which matches the sample's expected answer.

Thus, the error in the previous code was that the additional_total loop was adding the full contribution without subtracting the initial L[u} * L[v} term.

So the correct code must include this delta calculation.
