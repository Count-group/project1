Okay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of valid sequences where after each operation, P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct. That means, after each step, all three must be equal, or exactly two must be equal and the third different. Wait, no. Wait, pairwise distinct would mean that all three are different. So the main rule is that after each action, the three are not pairwise distinct. So allowed cases are: all three equal, or exactly two equal and one different. Because if all three are pairwise distinct, that's invalid. So the allowed states are when there's at least two equal.

Hmm, the original approach in the code uses two states: State A (all equal) and State B (exactly two equal, with a stored XOR value for the third). But perhaps there's a mistake in the transitions, especially when handling zero elements and the non-zero elements.

Looking at the sample input. Let's take the first test case:

3
1 7 9

The correct output is 3. The valid sequences are PPP, QQQ, RRR. So each step must assign the same variable. Because each step's choice must ensure that after each step, all three variables are not pairwise distinct.

Wait, after each step. For example, after the first step, if you choose P = 1, then Q and R are 0. So P is 1, Q and R are 0. So Q and R are equal, but P is different. So this is allowed, because the three variables are not pairwise distinct (since two are same). So after first step, P is 1, Q and R are 0. So it's allowed.

Wait, but the sample says that the only valid sequences are all P, all Q, all R. But according to that, the first step could be Q, leading to Q=1, P and R=0. Then next step could be Q again, making Q=1^7=6, P=0, R=0. Then after second step, Q=6, others are 0. So all three are pairwise distinct (since all are different: 6, 0, 0? Wait no. If Q is 6, P and R are 0. Then two are same (P and R), so the three are not pairwise distinct. So that's allowed. Then the third step could be Q again. So the sequence QQQ is allowed. But according to the sample explanation, the correct sequences are all PPP, QQQ, RRR. So perhaps the code is missing some possibilities where in some steps you assign different variables but still maintain the non-pairwise distinct condition.

Wait, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect. Let's think again.

The initial approach uses two states:

- State A: all three equal (P = Q = R).

- State B: exactly two equal, and the third different. The code tracks this with a dictionary where the key is the XOR value of the third variable (the one that's different). For example, if P and Q are equal, R is different, then the key is R's value. Or if Q and R are equal, P is different, then the key is P's value. But how does the code track which pair is equal? It seems like the code doesn't track which variables are equal, just the value of the third variable. But if that's the case, then different scenarios where different pairs are equal would be merged into the same key. So perhaps this approach is missing some cases.

For example, suppose after step 1, P is 1, Q and R are 0. So the state is B with key 1 (since the third variable is P). Then in step 2, if we assign Q to XOR with a2. Then Q becomes 0 ^ a2. Suppose a2 is 7, then Q is 7, P is 1, R is 0. Now all three are different (1,7,0). This would be invalid, so this sequence is invalid. So the code needs to count only those transitions that don't lead to invalid states.

But the code's approach for State B is when exactly two variables are equal. So when processing a new number, for each possible current state (A or B), the code calculates transitions.

Wait, the code's approach for State B is when exactly two variables are equal, and the third is different. The key in the dictionary is the value of the third variable. So when handling a new element, when you choose which variable to XOR with, the code needs to model the transitions correctly.

Let's think about when the code handles a non-zero element.

In the code, for a non-zero element num:

- The newA is 2 * dpB.get(num, 0). So if there are B states where the third variable is num, then XORing one of the two equal variables (so that their XOR becomes equal to the third variable) would make all three equal. Because suppose in state B, two variables (say P and Q) are equal to x, and R is x ^ s (s is the stored key). If we XOR P with num, then P becomes x ^ num. Then for all three to be equal, we need x ^ num = Q (which is x) and also equal to R (x ^ s). So that's only possible if num is 0, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect here.

Alternatively, maybe the code's approach is that when you are in state B (two variables equal, third is s), then when you assign the third variable to XOR with num, then the new value of the third variable is s ^ num. So the state would transition to a new B state with key s ^ num. If you assign one of the equal variables, then that variable becomes (equal value) ^ num. The other equal variable remains the same. So now, the two variables that were equal are now (x ^ num) and x. So unless x ^ num == x (which requires num is 0), these two would be different. So the new state would have the third variable (the one not modified) being x, and the modified variable and the other (previously equal) are now x and x ^ num. So in this case, the state would have two variables (the modified one and the other equal) different, and the third variable is x. So this would be a B state where two variables are equal (the third variable and the one not modified?), or maybe a new B state with a different pair.

But perhaps the code's approach doesn't account for all possible pairs. Because in state B, the code tracks the value of the third variable (s), but not which pair is equal. So the code's model might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the key s represents the XOR between the two equal variables and the third. For example, in state B, two variables are equal, and the third is s. So, for example, if P and Q are equal to x, and R is x ^ s. But then, s would be R's value XOR x. But this may not be unique. So perhaps the code's model is not capturing the correct scenarios.

This might explain why the code is failing some test cases.

Let's look at the first sample input again. The code's initial approach for the first test case:

Test case 1:

n=3, a=[1,7,9]

The correct answer is 3. Let's see how the code processes this.

Initially, dpA=1 (all variables are 0, so equal). dpB is empty.

Processing the first element, 1. It's non-zero.

newA is 2 * dpB.get(1, 0) = 0. Because dpB is empty.

Then newB is calculated. From A (dpA=1), when processing a non-zero element, transitions from A to B with s=num (1). So newB[1] += 1*3. So newB is {1:3}.

So after first step, dpA is 0, dpB is {1:3}.

Processing the second element, 7. Also non-zero.

newA is 2 * dpB.get(7,0) = 0.

newB:

From A (dpA=0, no contribution).

From B entries (s=1, count=3). Each step:

When you process a non-zero element, for each s in dpB:

If you assign the third variable (s=1) to XOR with 7, then new_s = 1^7=6. So newB[6] +=3*1=3.

If you assign one of the equal variables, which are x, and the third is x^s. Let's say the two equal variables are x, and the third is x^s. When you XOR one of the equal variables with 7, it becomes x^7. The other equal variable is x. So now, the two variables that were equal are now x and x^7, and the third is x^s. For the state to transition to B again, exactly two must be equal.

So for example, maybe x^7 == x^s. Then, the two variables would be x^7 and x^s, and the third is x. So that's possible only if 7 = s. But s is 1 here. So that's not the case. So in this case, the new state would have two variables (the modified equal variable and the third variable) equal? Or perhaps another pair.

Alternatively, maybe the code's transition for B when a non-zero element is processed is that when you XOR one of the equal variables (x), the new value is x^num, and then the two variables are x^num and x. So for the next state, the third variable is x^s. So the three variables are x^num, x, x^s.

We need to check which pairs are equal.

If x^num == x → num must be 0, but num is 7 here. So no equality. So the three variables are x^7, x, x^s. Are any two equal?

We need to find if any pair is equal. For example, x^7 = x^s → 7 = s. If s is 1 here, then 7 is not equal to 1 → no. Or x = x^s → s must be 0. Also not the case here.

So in this case, all three variables are different. So this transition would be invalid, so it's not allowed. Therefore, when in state B (s=1) and processing a non-zero element (7), assigning to the equal variables would lead to an invalid state, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only valid transitions are when you assign to the third variable (s=1) leading to s=6. So the newB would have s=6 with count 3. So after the second step, dpA=0, dpB={6:3}.

Processing the third element, 9. Again non-zero.

newA is 2 * dpB.get(9,0) → 0.

newB:

From B entries (s=6, count=3). Assigning to the third variable (s=6) → new_s =6^9=15. So newB[15] +=3*1=3.

If you assign to the equal variables (x and x). Suppose the current state is that two variables are equal to x, and third is x^6. Assigning one of the equal variables (x) to XOR with 9 gives x^9. Then the variables are x^9, x, x^6. Are any two equal?

x^9 == x → 9=0, which is not the case. x^9 == x^6 → 9=6 → no. x == x^6 → 6=0 → no. So all three are different. So this transition is invalid and cannot be done. Therefore, after processing the third element, the newB is {15:3}.

So the total is dpA (0) + sum(dpB.values()) (3) → 3. Which matches the sample. So why does the code work for the first sample?

But the code's approach seems to be passing the first sample correctly. Let's check the second sample.

Sample 2:

n=4

a = [179, 1, 1, 179]

Sample output is 9.

The valid sequences are those where all steps are the same variable (PPPP, QQQQ, etc.), but also sequences where the first three are P, then the fourth can be any (PPP followed by any of P, Q, R). But according to the sample explanation, the valid sequences are PPPP, PPPQ, PPPR, QQQP, QQQQ, QQQR, RRRP, RRRQ, RRRR. So total 9.

So the code's approach should calculate 9.

Let's see how the code processes this case.

Initial state: dpA=1, dpB empty.

Process first element 179 (non-zero).

newA = 2 * dpB.get(179, 0) → 0.

newB: from A (dpA=1), transitions to B with s=179. So newB[179] = 1*3 =3.

Now, dpA=0, dpB={179:3}.

Process second element 1 (non-zero).

newA = 2 * dpB.get(1, 0) → 0.

newB:

From B entries (s=179, count=3). Assigning to the third variable (179 XOR 1 → 178). So newB[178] +=3.

Also, transitions from B when assigning to the equal variables. Let's see:

Each of the 3 choices (P, Q, R) in the current state. Wait, no. The code's approach for B when a non-zero element is processed:

The code adds for transitions from B by XORing the third variable (so the key becomes s^num) and adds cnt to newB[s^num].

Then, transitions from A (if any) to B by adding 3 * dpA (but dpA is 0 here).

So for the current step, the newB is {178:3}.

dpA remains 0.

Third element is 1 (non-zero).

newA is 2 * dpB.get(1, 0) → 0 (current B is {178:3}).

newB:

from B (s=178, count=3). XOR with 1: 178^1=179. newB[179] +=3.

So now, dpB is {179:3}, dpA=0.

Fourth element is 179 (non-zero).

newA is 2 * dpB.get(179,0) → 2*3=6.

newB:

from B (s=179, count=3). XORing third variable (179) with 179 gives 0. So newB[0] +=3.

So after processing, newA is 6, newB has {0:3}.

Total is 6 + 3 =9, which matches the sample. So the code passes this case.

So why is there a problem? Maybe the code fails on another test case. Let's check the third sample:

Sample 3:

5

1 2 3 3 2

Output: 39.

Hmm, let's see. The code may not be handling the transitions correctly for some elements. Let's try to simulate it.

But simulating all steps would be time-consuming. Let's see why the code might be wrong.

The code's handling of zero elements:

When the current element is zero, the code's transitions are:

newA is dpA *3 (since XOR with zero leaves the variable unchanged. So all three choices (P, Q, R) XOR with zero, so variables remain as before. So if in state A, all variables are equal, then after XOR with zero, they remain equal. So all three choices contribute to state A.

For state B (exactly two variables equal), XORing any of the three variables with zero leaves them as before. So choosing to assign to any variable will not change their values. So the state remains B. So all three choices are allowed, and the count is multiplied by 3.

So for example, if in state B (s=5), and the current element is 0, then after processing, the new state B would have s=5, with count multiplied by 3.

But in the code, for a zero element, newA is 3 * dpA, and newB is each entry in dpB multiplied by 3. This seems correct.

Now, let's think about the fifth sample:

Input: 1

1000000000

Output: 3.

After processing the first element (1000000000), the code:

It's non-zero. So newA is 2 * dpB.get(1000000000, 0) → 0.

newB: from A (dpA=1) → newB[1000000000] +=1*3 →3.

So dpA is 0, dpB is {1000000000:3}. Sum is 3, which matches the sample. So code works here.

Hmm. So why the user says the code doesn't pass all samples? Maybe in the third sample, the code is incorrect.

Sample 3:

5

1 2 3 3 2

Sample output:39.

Let's try to see how the code processes this.

Initial state: dpA=1, dpB={}.

Processing first element 1 (non-zero):

newA = 0.

newB: from A, add s=1 with count 3.

So dpA=0, dpB={1:3}.

Processing second element 2 (non-zero):

newA=0.

newB: from B entries (s=1, count=3).

When processing 2, each entry in B can transition in two ways:

For each s in B (1):

- XOR the third variable: new_s =1^2=3. So newB[3] +=3.

- XOR one of the equal variables: but this would lead to two variables (x^2 and x), third variable x^s (x^1). So the variables are x^2, x, x^1. Are any two equal?

x^2 =x → 2=0 → no.

x^2 =x^1 → 2=1 → no.

x =x^1 →1=0 → no.

So all three are distinct. So this transition is invalid. So the only valid transition is to XOR the third variable, leading to s=3, count=3.

So dpB becomes {3:3}, dpA=0.

Third element is 3 (non-zero):

newA=2 * dpB.get(3,0) →2*3=6.

newB:

From B entries (s=3, count=3).

XORing third variable gives s^3=3^3=0. So newB[0] +=3.

Also, transitions from A (dpA=6? Wait, no. newA is 6. But how are the transitions for this step.

Wait, processing third element 3, which is non-zero.

newA is 6 (from 2 * dpB.get(3,0) → 2*3=6).

Then newB:

- Transitions from A (dpA=6). But in this step, the previous state after processing third element is:

After processing third element, the newA is 6. But how are these transitions handled.

Wait, during processing third element:

Original code:

For non-zero num:

newA is 2 * dpB.get(num, 0) → here, num is 3, current dpB is {3:3} → 2*3=6.

Then newB is computed as:

- From A (dpA= previous dpA, which was 0 before this step. Because the newA is being computed for this step. So in this step, the code uses the current dpA (from the previous step, which is 0) when calculating transitions from A.

So transitions from A to B with s=3. Since dpA (previous) is 0, no contribution.

Then, transitions from B entries (s=3, count=3):

XORing third variable (s=3) with num=3 → s becomes 0. So newB[0] +=3.

Also, when you XOR the equal variables (x and x), then the new values would be x^3 and x. The third variable is x^3 (original s is 3, which is x ^ third_var). Wait, perhaps the code's approach here is wrong.

Wait, when in state B (s=3), the two equal variables are x and x, and the third variable is x ^ 3. So when you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with num=3, it becomes x^3. The other equal variable remains x. The third variable is x^3. So now, the variables are x^3, x, x^3. So two variables are equal (x^3 and x^3). So now, all three variables are either equal (if x = x^3) or two are equal.

So x ^3 ==x → 3=0, which is not possible. So the variables are x, x^3, x^3. So two variables are equal. So this is a valid state. So the third variable is x, and the other two are equal. The key in the code's state B would be x. But how is x related to the previous state's s?

In the previous state, the third variable's value was x ^3 (since s=3). So x ^3 is the third variable's value in the previous state. So when you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with num=3, you get x^3. Now, the variables are x, x^3 (modified), and x^3 (third variable). So two variables (modified and third) are equal. So the third variable is x, which is the unmodified equal variable. Or wait:

Wait, in the previous state, two variables are x, and the third is x ^ s (s=3). So third variable is x ^3.

When you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with num=3, you get x^3. The other equal variable remains x. The third variable remains x^3.

So now, the variables are x^3 (modified), x, x^3 (third). So modified and third are equal. The third variable is now x^3. The two equal variables are x^3 and x^3, and the other is x. So the third variable in the new state is x, and the key would be x. But x is the previous value of the equal variables. But how does the code track this?

The code's approach for transitions from B when assigning to the equal variables is as follows:

When you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with num, you get x ^ num. The other equal variable is x, and the third variable is x ^ s. So new variables are x ^ num, x, x ^ s. Are any two equal?

For two variables to be equal:

Case 1: x ^ num == x → num must be 0. Not the case here.

Case 2: x ^ num == x ^ s → num = s.

In this step, s is 3, num is 3. So yes. So x ^ num = x ^3, which equals the third variable (x^3). So variables are x^3, x, x^3. So two variables are x^3 (the modified equal variable and the third variable). So in this case, the new state is a B state where two variables are equal (x^3 and x^3), and the third is x. The key for the new B state is x.

So the code's approach should account for this. In this case, since num = s (3), then x ^ num = x ^ s, which equals the third variable. So XORing an equal variable with num (3) leads to a new B state where the third variable is x, with key x.

So for the current step, when s=3 and num=3:

If you XOR an equal variable (x) with num=3, you get x^3. The third variable is x^3. So now, two variables are x^3 (modified and third), and the other is x. So the key for this new B state is x.

But how is x calculated?

The previous state's key is s=3. So the previous state's third variable is x^3. The equal variables are x and x. So x can be anything. So the key s=3 is (third variable) XOR x.

Wait, in the previous state, s=3. That means that third variable is x ^3, where x is the value of the two equal variables. So x is the value of the two equal variables. So third variable is x ^3 = x ^ s.

So when you XOR an equal variable (x) with num=3, the new value is x^3. The third variable is x^3. So now, the variables are x^3 (modified), x, x^3 (third). So two variables are x^3, and one is x. So the new B state has key x.

But x can be any value. How does the code track this?

In the code's current approach, when processing a non-zero element:

For transitions from B:

Each entry in dpB is s: count. For each s, when you assign to the third variable (s), new_s = s ^ num. So the code adds count to newB[new_s].

When you assign to one of the equal variables, the code checks if the num equals s. Because in that case, x ^ num equals x ^ s, which equals the third variable. So this would create a new state where two variables are equal (x^s and third variable), and the third is x. So the new state's key is x.

But how to model this in the code.

In the code, when you are in state B with key s, and you assign to an equal variable, the code seems to check if the current num equals s. Because in that case, x ^ num = x ^ s = third variable, so two variables are equal. The new key would be x.

But x is not tracked directly. The previous key s is third variable's value (x ^ s_prev), where s_prev is the previous s.

Wait, perhaps the code's approach misses these transitions when num equals s. For example, in the third step of sample 3:

After processing the third element (3), the code's newA is 6 (from 2 * dpB.get(3, 0) → 2*3=6).

Then, when processing the third element (3), the code's newB is computed as follows:

- From B entries (s=3, count=3):

   - XORing the third variable: new_s =3^3=0. So newB[0] +=3.

   - XORing the equal variables: since num=3 equals s=3, then for each count, the code would generate transitions to state A? Or to state B with new keys?

Wait, according to the code's logic:

For a non-zero element, when processing a B state (s=3, count=3):

For each entry in B, the code transitions to newB by XORing the third variable (so new_s is s ^ num).

Then, the code considers transitions from B when you assign to the equal variables. For this, the code's logic is to check if XORing the equal variables would lead to state A.

Wait, in the code:

For transitions from B when assigning to equal variables:

The code's newA is incremented by 2 * dpB.get(num, 0). Which suggests that for each B entry where s == num, XORing one of the equal variables (which is x) with num would lead to x ^ num. Since s= num, this is x ^ s. The third variable was x ^ s. So x ^ s = third variable. So x ^ num (which is x ^ s) is equal to the third variable. So after this operation, the modified equal variable becomes x ^ s, which is equal to the third variable. The other equal variable is x, and the third is x ^ s. So the three variables are x ^ s, x, x ^ s. So two are equal (x^s). So the third variable is x. So the state becomes B with key x.

But how is x related to s?

In the previous state B, the third variable is x ^ s. So x = (third variable) ^ s.

But in the code, the key s is the third variable's value. Wait, no. The code's model is that in state B, two variables are equal (say x), and the third is s. So third variable is s. So the three variables are x, x, s.

So when you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with num, the new value is x ^ num. The third variable is s.

So the three variables after this operation are x ^ num, x, s.

For these three variables to have two equal, there must be:

x ^ num == x → num=0 (not the case).

Or x ^ num == s → num = x ^ s.

Or x == s → s=x. Which would imply that all three variables are x, x, s=x. Which is state A.

So in the code's model, when you assign to an equal variable in state B (x, x, s), then the new variables are x^num, x, s. For this to be a valid state (not pairwise distinct), at least two must be equal.

The code's approach is to compute newA as 2 * dpB.get(num, 0). So when the third variable (s) is equal to x ^ num, then XORing one of the equal variables (x) with num would result in x^num = s. So the three variables would be s, x, s. Which means two are equal (s), so the new state is B with key x.

But the code's newA is calculated as 2 * dpB.get(num, 0). So for each entry in B where s == num, the code adds 2 * count to newA.

Wait, the code's newA is computed as:

newA = (2 * dpB.get(num, 0)) % MOD.

So if there are entries in B where the third variable s equals num, then newA is increased by 2 times their count.

This suggests that when s == num, XORing one of the equal variables would lead to all three variables being equal.

Wait, how?

If in state B (x, x, s), and you XOR one of the x's with num:

The new value is x ^ num.

If s == num, then x ^ num = x ^ s.

But in state B, the third variable is s. So the new variables are x ^ s, x, s.

For these to be all equal, x ^ s must equal x and s. Which would require s=0 and x=0. But in general, this is not the case.

Wait, this suggests that the code's approach to newA is incorrect. Let's think:

The code's newA is 2 * dpB.get(num, 0). So when there's a B entry with s == num, the code adds 2 * count to newA. This implies that for each such entry, there are two possible choices that lead to state A.

But why two?

In state B, s is the third variable. So two variables are x and x, and the third is s.

If you XOR one of the x's with num, and if num == s, then x ^ num = x ^ s.

But since s is the third variable, how can this lead to all three variables being equal?

For example:

Original state: x, x, s (s is the third variable).

num is s.

If you XOR one of the x's with s → new value x ^ s.

So the variables are x ^ s, x, s.

For all three to be equal:

x ^ s == x → s=0.

x ^ s == s → x must be 0.

If both x=0 and s=0, then all are zero. But this is state A.

But in the code's logic, when s == num (which is s == s), then the code adds 2 * count to newA.

But in this case, it's only possible to reach state A if x ^ s == x and x ^ s == s. Which requires x = 0 and s=0.

So the code's approach of adding 2 * count when s == num is wrong, except when x ^ s = x and x ^ s = s.

But in general, this is not true.

This suggests that the code's logic for transitioning from B to A is incorrect.

Ah! This is a critical mistake. The code assumes that whenever you have a state B where the third variable is s, and you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with num, then if s == num, this results in state A. But this is only true if x ^ num equals s and x equals s. But that's not necessarily the case.

So the code's calculation of newA is incorrect.

For example, in the third step of sample 3:

Processing the third element (3), which is non-zero.

In the previous step, after processing the second element, dpB is {3:3} (s=3).

When processing num=3, the code computes newA as 2 * dpB.get(3, 0) → 6.

Then, transitions from B entries (s=3, count=3):

- XORing the third variable (3) with num (3) gives 0. So newB[0] +=3.

- XORing the equal variables (x and x) with num (3) gives x^3. The third variable is s=3.

So the new variables are x^3, x, 3.

For these three to be not pairwise distinct, at least two must be equal.

Possible scenarios:

x^3 == x → 3 must be 0 (no).

x^3 == 3 → x must be 0.

x == 3 → x=3.

So:

If x == 3: then variables are 0, 3,3 → Q and R are equal. So this is state B with s=0.

If x ==0: variables are 3,0,3 → two equal (3's), so state B with s=0.

Other cases: variables are x^3, x,3. For example, x=1: 1^3=2, 1,3 → all distinct → invalid.

So the only valid transitions from B (s=3) when num=3 are when x=3 or x=0.

But how does the code track this?

The code's current approach for newA (adding 2 * count when s=num) is incorrect. Because in this case, the transitions from B (s=3, count=3) when num=3 would lead to newA +=2*3=6, which implies that there are 2*3=6 ways to transition to state A. But this is only possible if x^3 ==x and x^3 ==3, which requires x=0 and 3=0 (impossible), or other impossible conditions.

So the code's logic for newA is wrong. This explains why the code might not pass certain test cases.

The correct way to transition from B to A is when XORing one of the equal variables leads to all three variables being equal. For that to happen:

After XORing one of the equal variables (x) with num, the new value must be equal to the third variable (s), and the other equal variable (x) must also be equal to s. So x == s, and x ^ num == s. So x must be s, and s ^ num == s → num must be 0. But num is non-zero.

This is only possible if num is zero. But in this case, num is 3, which is not zero. So the code's approach for transitioning to state A from B is wrong.

Thus, the code's calculation of newA is incorrect in cases where s == num.

This means that the code will generate incorrect results for cases where there are transitions from B to A that are not possible.

In the third sample, this mistake could lead to incorrect counts.

So, the correct approach for newA should be:

newA is the number of ways where XORing one of the equal variables leads to all three variables being equal.

But this can only happen if x ^ num == s and x == s. So x ^ num == x → num must be 0. So this can only happen when num is zero and s is x.

But since the code's current approach allows newA to be non-zero even when num is non-zero, this is incorrect.

So, the code's newA calculation is wrong. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

The correct approach is to only transition to state A when all three variables become equal, which can happen in two ways:

1. When in state A, all variables are x, and you XOR any variable with zero. Then they all remain x. So state A.

2. When in state B, and you XOR one of the equal variables with a number that makes it equal to the third variable, and the other equal variable is already equal to the third variable. This is possible only if num is zero. So, in this case, the code's newA calculation is wrong.

Therefore, the code's newA should only be updated when num is zero. But the current code allows newA to be updated for non-zero nums, which is incorrect.

This means that the code's logic is fundamentally flawed. The correct transitions need to be re-evaluated.

Let's re-express the problem:

Each step, after choosing which variable to XOR with a_i, the three variables must not be pairwise distinct. So after each step, the variables can be:

- All equal.

- Exactly two equal, one different.

The code uses two states: A (all equal) and B (exactly two equal, tracked by the third variable's value).

But the transitions for non-zero elements are incorrectly handled.

Let's re-express the transitions:

For a given step with element a_i:

When in state A (all variables are x):

Choosing any of the three variables (P, Q, R) to XOR with a_i:

- If a_i is 0, then all variables remain x. So state A. So each choice contributes to state A.

- If a_i is not 0, then XORing any variable will make it x ^ a_i. The other two variables are x. So the three variables are x, x, x^a_i. So two are equal (x), one is different (x^a_i). So this is state B, with s = x^a_i. But x is the initial value (before XOR). So x can be anything. So for each choice, we transition to state B with s = x ^ a_i. But x is the current value of the variables in state A. So in state A, variables are x, and after XORing with a_i, they become x ^ a_i, x, x. So the third variable is x ^ a_i, and the two others are x. So the key for state B is x ^ a_i.

But how to track x? Since in state A, variables are x, but x can be any value. So when transitioning from state A to B with a_i, the key in state B is x ^ a_i. But x is the value before processing. However, since the code's state B tracks the third variable's value (which is x ^ a_i), this is correct.

But when the code transitions from state A to B with key a_i (the third variable's value is a_i), this is only correct if x is 0. Because in state A, variables are x (equal). For example, if state A is x=0, then XORing with a_i gives 0 ^ a_i = a_i, so the third variable is a_i. So state B's key is a_i.

But if the variables in state A are x=5, then XORing one variable with a_i gives 5 ^ a_i, and the third variable's value is 5 ^ a_i. So the key in state B is 5 ^ a_i, not a_i. But the code's current approach for non-zero a_i and transitioning from A to B adds 3 * dpA to newB[num], where num is a_i. This is incorrect.

This is a critical mistake. Because in state A, the variables are x. When you XOR a variable with a_i, the new third variable is x ^ a_i. The code assumes that x is 0, which is only true initially.

But in reality, state A can have x as any value. So when you transition from state A to B, the key should be x ^ a_i, but x is the current value of the variables in state A. So for state A, which tracks the count of ways where variables are x, but x can be any value, the code cannot represent this with a single value. This suggests that the code's model is incorrect.

Ah! This is the root of the problem. The code's state A represents all possible cases where P=Q=R, but it doesn't track the current value of P/Q/R. It only tracks the number of ways to be in state A, regardless of the current value. This is incorrect because when transitioning from state A to B, the key s depends on the current value of the variables.

For example, suppose after some steps, you're in state A with variables equal to x. Processing a non-zero a_i would transition to state B with s = x ^ a_i. But the code's current approach assumes that transitioning from state A to B with s = a_i. This is only correct when x is 0. But after some steps, x can be any value.

So the code's model is incorrect. It tracks the number of ways to be in state A, but not the actual value of the variables in state A. This leads to incorrect transitions when processing non-zero elements.

This explains why the code works for samples where all transitions are from state A with x=0 (like the first sample), but fails for cases where state A has x !=0.

For example, consider the case where in state A, variables are x=5. Processing a_i=3 would transition to state B with s=5^3=6. But the code's current approach would transition to state B with s=3, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code's model is fundamentally flawed. It cannot track the correct transitions from state A when the variables are not zero.

Therefore, the code needs to be completely reworked to track the current value of the variables in state A.

But how can we do this efficiently?

The correct approach must track for state A the current value of P=Q=R. However, for large n, this is impossible as the value can be up to 1e9. So the code must find a way to track this without explicitly storing all possible values.

The key observation is that when processing elements in the array, the transitions for state A depend on the XOR of the current value with the element.

But how?

Let's think differently. State A can be represented by a map that tracks the count of ways to be in state A with a specific value x. But for large n, this could be infeasible.

Alternatively, note that when processing a non-zero element, any transition from state A will lead to state B with s = x ^ a_i for each x in state A. But if there are multiple x values, this could lead to an explosion in the number of keys in state B.

This suggests that the code's approach of not tracking the current value of x in state A is incorrect and leads to wrong transitions.

Therefore, the correct approach should track for state A the possible x values and their counts. Similarly, state B must track the possible s values and their counts, along with the pair of variables that are equal.

But tracking the pair of variables is also complex. However, the problem allows us to model state B by tracking the XOR between the two equal variables and the third. For example, if two variables are equal to x, and the third is x ^ s, then s is the XOR between the two equal variables and the third. However, this may not capture all scenarios uniquely.

Given the complexity of the problem, perhaps a different approach is needed.

An alternative approach is to model the state as the set of possible values of (P, Q, R). However, this is impossible due to the large possible values.

But perhaps we can find that certain patterns emerge. For example, when processing a new element, the valid sequences can be expressed in terms of combinations of the previous state's counts.

Let's think about the problem differently. For each step, the valid sequences are those where after each step, the variables are not pairwise distinct.

At each step, when processing a_i, the choice is to assign the XOR to P, Q, or R. The new state must satisfy the condition that not all three are pairwise distinct.

Let's model the state as follows:

- State 0: All three variables are equal. The count is the number of ways to reach this state.

- State 1: Exactly two variables are equal, and the third is different. The count is the number of ways to reach this state.

But this would be insufficient, as we need to track the value of the third variable. However, when processing a_i, the transitions depend on whether the new assignment leads to two variables being equal or all three.

Wait, but perhaps we can model the problem using the following states:

- State A: All three variables are equal (counts as a).

- State B: Exactly two variables are equal (counts as b).

The total number of valid sequences after each step is a + b.

The transitions between these states can be determined based on the current a and b, and the value of a_i.

But how?

When processing a_i:

If you are in state A (all variables are x):

- You can assign to any of the three variables. The new variables after assignment are:

   - For assignment to P: new P is x ^ a_i, Q and R are x. So two variables are x, one is x ^ a_i. This is state B.

   - Similarly for Q and R. So all three choices lead to state B.

So from state A, regardless of a_i (unless a_i is 0), the transition is to state B.

But if a_i is 0:

- Assigning to any variable leaves it as x. So all variables remain x. So transitions to state A.

So, when in state A:

if a_i == 0:

   new_a += a * 3 (each of the three choices leaves variables in A).

else:

   new_b += a * 3.

Now, for state B:

In state B, exactly two variables are equal. Let's say variables are x, x, y (y different from x). The three variables after assigning to any of them:

Case 1: Assign to one of the equal variables (x):

- new value is x ^ a_i.

The variables become x ^ a_i, x, y.

For these to be not pairwise distinct:

Either x ^ a_i == x → a_i == 0. Or x ^ a_i == y. Or x == y.

But since we are in state B, x != y. So:

If a_i == 0:

   variables are x, x, y → which is state B. So this transition is allowed.

   So choosing to assign to an equal variable when a_i is 0 leaves the state as B.

   So for each of the two equal variables (since there are two in state B), there are two choices. So the number of ways is 2 * b (for a_i ==0).

If a_i !=0:

   variables are x^a_i, x, y. For these to be not pairwise distinct, at least two must be equal.

   This can happen if x^a_i == x (a_i=0, which is not the case), x^a_i == y, or x == y (but x != y in state B).

   So the only possibility is x^a_i == y.

   If this is the case, then variables are x^a_i, x, x^a_i → two variables are equal (x^a_i), so state B. The third variable is x. The new s would be x.

   So this transition is possible only if y = x ^ a_i.

   The count depends on how many ways this condition is met in the current state B.

   But the state B's count is stored as a single value, not tracking individual x and y values. So this approach is insufficient.

This suggests that the problem cannot be modeled with just two states (A and B), but requires tracking more information about the current values of the variables.

Thus, the correct approach is to track state A as a map of current value x to the number of ways to reach it, and state B as a map of the XOR difference between the two equal variables and the third.

But for large values, this is not feasible. However, the XOR operation has properties that allow certain simplifications.

Another observation: when the variables are in state B (x, x, y), the XOR of the two equal variables (x) and the third variable (y) is s = x ^ y. This s uniquely defines the relationship between the two equal variables and the third. Thus, state B can be modeled by tracking the value of s.

In this model:

- State A is a single value x, but since we can't track all x, perhaps the count for state A is multiplied by the number of possible x values. But this seems impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled with state A's count and a single value x, but this is only possible if all transitions from state A depend on x in a way that can be aggregated.

But I'm not sure. This seems complex.

Given the time constraints and the fact that the code passes some samples but not all, perhaps the correct approach is to re-express the problem with the correct state transitions.

Let's try to correct the code's approach by fixing the transitions for state A and state B.

The key mistake is in the handling of state A transitions for non-zero elements. The code assumes that transitioning from state A to B with s = a_i, but in reality, s is x ^ a_i, where x is the value of variables in state A. However, the code's current approach does not track x, so this is incorrect.

To handle this, state A must track the current XOR value of the variables. But for large n, this is not feasible. However, there's a way to model this correctly using the properties of XOR.

When in state A, the variables are all x. Processing a non-zero element a_i:

Each of the three choices (assign to P, Q, or R) results in variables x ^ a_i, x, x. So the third variable is x ^ a_i, and the two others are x. This is state B, where the XOR between the two equal variables (x) and the third variable (x ^ a_i) is x ^ (x ^ a_i) = a_i. So, the key s for state B is a_i.

This is correct! Because the two equal variables are x, and the third is x ^ a_i. The XOR between x and x ^ a_i is a_i. So regardless of x, the key s is a_i.

Thus, when transitioning from state A (x) to B for non-zero a_i, the key s is a_i. This is correct, and the code's initial approach was correct.

Wait, let's compute s:

s = x ^ (x ^ a_i) = a_i. Yes. So the key s in state B is a_i, regardless of x.

Thus, the code's approach for transitioning from state A to B for non-zero a_i is correct. Because the key s is a_i.

Thus, the code's initial approach is correct in this aspect.

Now, the mistake must be elsewhere.

Let's re-examine the newA calculation.

In the code, newA is calculated as 2 * dpB.get(num, 0).

This is supposed to account for transitions from state B to state A when XORing one of the equal variables.

But when you are in state B (s), and you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with num, the new variables are x^num, x, s.

For these to be in state A (all equal), all three must be equal. So x^num == x and x == s.

This requires num ==0 and x == s. But if num !=0, this is impossible. So the code's newA should be non-zero only when num is zero.

But the code allows newA to be non-zero even when num is non-zero, leading to incorrect transitions.

So the code's newA calculation is incorrect for non-zero elements.

The correct condition for transitioning from state B to state A is when:

x^num == x and x == s.

Which implies num=0 and x=s.

So when processing a non-zero element, newA should be zero.

Thus, the code's newA calculation is wrong for non-zero elements.

The code's newA is calculated as 2 * dpB.get(num, 0). This implies that whenever there is an entry in dpB with s=num, it contributes 2 * count to newA. But this is only correct if the transition from B to A is possible, which requires num=0 and x= s.

Thus, the code's newA calculation is incorrect for non-zero elements. This explains why the code may produce wrong results.

To fix this, newA should be non-zero only when num is zero.

Thus, the code's logic for newA and newB needs to be adjusted:

For a non-zero element:

- newA can only be non-zero if num is zero, which is not the case. So newA should be zero.

- newA is calculated as 2 * dpB.get(num, 0) only when num is zero.

But the code currently calculates newA for any num.

This is the mistake.

Thus, the code's newA calculation is wrong for non-zero elements.

Therefore, the correct approach is to split the processing into cases based on whether a_i is zero or not.

Let's restructure the code:

For each element a_i:

If a_i is zero:

   newA = dpA * 3 (since all three choices leave variables in A if previously in A).

   newA += sum(2 * cnt for cnt in dpB.values()) (if in B, assigning to the equal variables (two choices) leads to A, and assigning to the third variable leaves B).

Wait, no. Let's re-examine:

For a_i =0:

When in state A (x):

   assigning to any variable leaves it as x. So all variables remain x. So newA += dpA *3.

When in state B (s):

   s is the XOR between the two equal variables (x) and the third variable (x ^ s).

   Assigning to one of the equal variables (x):

      new value is x ^0 =x. So variables remain x, x, x^s → state B.

   Assigning to the third variable (x^s):

      new value is (x^s) ^0 =x^s. So variables are x, x, x^s → state B.

   So no transitions to state A. So newA remains as dpA *3.

Thus, for a_i =0, newA is only contributed by state A.

So the code's initial approach for zero elements is correct.

For a_i !=0:

   newA is zero, except if there are transitions from B to A.

But transitions from B to A can only happen if:

   when you XOR one of the equal variables (x) with a_i, the new value (x ^ a_i) equals the third variable (x ^ s), and x equals x ^ s.

But x ^ a_i = x ^ s → a_i =s.

x equals x ^ s → s=0.

Thus, a_i must be zero, which is not the case.

So for non-zero a_i, transitions from B to A are impossible. Thus, newA should be zero.

But the code currently calculates newA as 2 * dpB.get(a_i, 0), which is incorrect.

Thus, the code's newA calculation for non-zero elements is wrong. It should be zero.

Thus, the correct newA for non-zero elements is zero.

This is a critical mistake. The code's newA is incorrectly computed as 2 * dpB.get(num, 0) for non-zero num, which introduces invalid transitions to state A.

So to fix the code, when handling non-zero elements, newA should be zero, and only transitions from B to B are allowed.

Thus, the corrected code should have:

For non-zero elements:

   newA = 0

   newB is computed as:

      from A: each choice transitions to B with s=num. So newB[num] += dpA *3.

      from B: for each s in dpB:

          new_s = s ^ num. newB[new_s] += cnt (assign to third variable).

          also, if s == num:

              then assigning to one of the two equal variables would transition to a new B with s = x. But according to previous analysis, this is not possible unless a_i is zero.

But since a_i is non-zero, this case is invalid. So no transitions to A.

Thus, in the code, for non-zero elements:

newA =0

newB is built from transitions from A and B.

Thus, the code's calculation of newA for non-zero elements is incorrect and should be zero.

This explains the errors in the code.

To fix the code, for non-zero elements:

newA = 0

Then, the newB is:

- From A: transitions to B with s=num. Count is dpA *3.

- From B: transitions to B with s^num, and any other valid transitions.

Thus, the code should be modified as follows:

In the case where num !=0:

newA =0

newB is initialized as:

   from A:

       if dpA >0:

           newB[num] += dpA *3

   from B:

       for each s in dpB:

           new_s = s ^ num

           newB[new_s] += cnt

Thus, the code's newA calculation for non-zero elements should be zero, not 2 * dpB.get(num, 0).

This is the key correction needed.

Let's adjust the code:

In the code, for the non-zero case:

Replace:

newA = (2 * dpB.get(num, 0)) % MOD

With:

newA = 0

And in newB transitions from B:

No other transitions except XORing the third variable.

Thus, the code's newB for non-zero elements is:

newB = defaultdict(int)

if dpA >0:

    newB[num] = (newB[num] + dpA *3) % MOD

for s, cnt in dpB.items():

    new_s = s ^ num

    newB[new_s] = (newB[new_s] + cnt) % MOD

Thus, the code's newA is 0, and newB is built correctly.

But this would change the code's behavior. Let's re-examine the first sample:

Sample 1:

n=3, a = [1,7,9]

Processing first element 1:

newA=0.

newB is from A (dpA=1): newB[1] +=3. So newB is {1:3}.

Processing second element 7:

newA=0.

newB is:

from A (dpA=0, no contribution).

from B (s=1, count=3):

new_s =1^7=6. newB[6] +=3.

So newB is {6:3}.

Processing third element 9:

newA=0.

newB is:

from A (dpA=0, no contribution).

from B (s=6, count=3):

new_s=6^9=15. newB[15] +=3.

Total is 0 +3 =3. Correct.

Sample 2:

n=4, a=[179,1,1,179].

Processing fourth element 179 (non-zero):

newA=0.

newB:

from B entries (s=179, count=3):

new_s =179^179=0. newB[0] +=3.

Also, from A (dpA=0).

Thus, newB is {0:3}.

Total is 0 +3 =3. But sample output is 9.

Wait, but according to this corrected code, the sample 2 would return 3, which is incorrect.

But this suggests that there's another mistake.

Wait, in the code's current approach, after processing the third element (1), the code's state is:

After third element:

For the third element (1):

num=1, which is non-zero.

newA=0.

newB:

from B (s=178, count=3):

new_s=178^1=179. newB[179] +=3.

So after third step, dpB is {179:3}.

Fourth element is 179 (non-zero):

newA=0.

newB:

from B (s=179, count=3):

new_s =179 ^179 =0. newB[0] +=3.

Thus, the total is 0 +3 =3. But the sample output is 9.

Thus, the corrected code would give the wrong answer for sample 2.

But according to the sample explanation, the valid sequences include those where all four steps are the same variable (like PPPP), which would be counted in state A after four steps. But according to the corrected code, newA is 0 for all steps except when a_i is zero. So how are these sequences counted?

Ah, the mistake is that in state B, when you assign to the third variable (s) with a_i equal to s, you get s^a_i =0. So in the fourth step, the variables become x, x, 0. This is state B with s=0. The total is sum of newB's values, which is 3. But the sample expects 9.

So there's a contradiction.

This indicates that the initial approach was wrong, and the corrected code also doesn't work.

Thus, there must be a misunderstanding of the problem.

Re-reading the problem statement:

The main rule: after each action, all three numbers P, Q, R are not pairwise distinct.

Pairwise distinct means all three are different. So if two are equal, it's allowed.

So the valid sequences are those where after each step, the three variables are either all equal, or exactly two are equal.

The code's original approach for non-zero elements assumed that transitions from B to A are possible when s == num. But according to our analysis, this is only possible when num is zero.

But in sample 2, the fourth element is 179, and after processing, the variables are in state B with s=0. But the valid sequences include those where all steps are the same variable (e.g., PPPP), which would end up in state B with s=0, but the correct answer is 9, which includes sequences like PPPP.

But according to the corrected code, after four steps, the total is 3 (sum of dpB.values()=3), but the sample expects 9.

This suggests that the initial approach is incorrect, and the corrected approach also doesn't work.

Thus, there's a fundamental misunderstanding in the state modeling.

Another approach: the valid sequences are those where, after each step, the three variables are not all distinct. This means that after each step, at least two variables are equal.

Let's think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming with three states:

- All variables are equal (state A).

- Exactly two variables are equal (state B).

- All variables are different (invalid state).

The transitions are:

For each step, and for each possible state (A or B), and for each possible choice of which variable to XOR, compute the new state.

The key is to model state B as the number of ways to have exactly two variables equal, regardless of which pair is equal.

Thus, the code can model:

- dpA: the number of ways where all variables are equal.

- dpB: the number of ways where exactly two variables are equal.

The transitions are:

For each element a_i:

If a_i is zero:

   When in state A:

      All three choices keep variables equal. So newA += dpA *3.

   When in state B:

      Assigning to any variable leaves two variables equal. For example, variables are x, x, y. Assigning to x (x^0 =x) leaves x, x, y → state B. Assigning to y (y^0 =y) leaves x, x, y → state B. So all three choices contribute to state B. So newB += dpB *3.

If a_i is not zero:

   When in state A (variables are x):

      Choosing any of the three variables to XOR with a_i leads to variables x^a_i, x, x. This is state B. So newB += dpA *3.

   When in state B:

      There are two possibilities: variables are x, x, y (y !=x). Assigning to x:

          new_x = x^a_i. Variables are x^a_i, x, y.

          To be valid, at least two must be equal.

          This can happen if x^a_i ==x (a_i=0, which is not the case), x^a_i == y, or x == y (which is not possible).

          So the only valid case is x^a_i == y.

          In this case, variables are x^a_i, x, x^a_i → two variables are equal. So state B.

          The number of ways for this is the number of ways where y == x^a_i.

          However, since we don't track x and y, this is difficult to model.

          Assigning to y:

          new_y = y^a_i. Variables are x, x, y^a_i.

          To be valid, at least two must be equal. This can happen if x == y^a_i.

          So the number of ways where x == y^a_i.

      So the total transitions from state B for a non-zero a_i:

      For each way in state B (counted in dpB), there are two possible valid transitions (assigning to x or y) when y ==x^a_i or x == y^a_i.

      But since we don't track x and y, it's impossible to compute this.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: in state B, the number of valid transitions when processing a non-zero a_i is 2. Because there are two possible valid choices (assigning to one of the two equal variables, which would transition to state B only if y ==x^a_i, or assigning to the third variable, which would transition to state B if x == y^a_i).

But without knowing x and y, it's impossible to compute this.

Thus, the correct model must track additional information.

Thus, the correct approach is to track:

- dpA: the number of ways where all variables are equal.

- dpB: a dictionary where the key is the XOR between the two equal variables and the third (s = x ^ y, where x is the value of the two equal variables, and y is the third).

When processing a non-zero a_i:

- From dpA, each choice leads to s = a_i. So newB[s] += dpA *3.

- From dpB's entries:

   For each s in dpB:

       The two equal variables are x, and the third is x^s.

       Assigning to the third variable: new_s = s ^ a_i. This is because the new third variable is x^s ^ a_i. The two equal variables are x. The new s is x ^ (x^s ^ a_i) = s ^ a_i.

       So newB[s ^ a_i] += cnt.

       Assigning to one of the equal variables:

           The new value is x ^ a_i.

           The two variables are x ^ a_i and x. The third variable is x^s.

           For this to be valid, either x^a_i == x^s (so a_i == s), or x == x^s (so s ==0).

           If a_i == s:

               The new variables are x^a_i, x, x^s =x^a_i (since s=a_i). So the two equal variables are x and x^s =x^a_i =x^s → x^a_i =x^s. So s =a_i.

               Then the new variables are x^s, x, x^s. The third variable is x. So the new s is x^s ^x = s.

               This is incorrect. Alternatively, the new variables are x^s, x, x^s → the third variable is x, so the new s is x^s ^x = s.

               But this seems to not change s.

           If s ==0:

               The third variable is x^0 =x. So all variables are x. So transitioning to state A.

               So newA += cnt * 2 (since there are two equal variables to choose from).

           So for each s in dpB:

               if a_i == s:

                   newB[s] += cnt * 2.

               if s ==0:

                   newA += cnt * 2 * (a_i ==0). But a_i is non-zero in this case.

               else:

                   no transition.

       Thus, the code should handle these transitions.

But this is complex.

The correct transitions when processing a non-zero a_i from state B are:

For each s in dpB:

   // Assigning to the third variable: new_s = s ^ a_i. Always valid.

   newB[s ^ a_i] += cnt.

   // Assigning to one of the two equal variables: valid if x^a_i == third variable (x^s) → a_i == s.

   if a_i == s:

       newB[s] += cnt * 2.

   // Also, if s ==0, then third variable is x, so assigning to an equal variable x gives x^a_i. For this to equal third variable x, a_i must be 0 (not the case).

Thus, the code should add:

   if a_i == s:

       newB[s] += cnt * 2.

Thus, the code's newB transitions should include both:

   newB[s ^ a_i] += cnt

   if a_i == s:

       newB[s] += cnt *2

Thus, the code's newB calculation for non-zero a_i is:

newB = defaultdict(int)

if dpA >0:

    newB[a_i] = (newB[a_i] + dpA *3) % MOD

for s, cnt in dpB.items():

    new_s = s ^ a_i

    newB[new_s] = (newB[new_s] + cnt) % MOD

    if s == a_i:

        newB[s] = (newB[s] + cnt * 2) % MOD

This is a crucial missing part in the original code. The code did not consider the case where s == a_i when transitioning from B by assigning to one of the equal variables.

This explains why the code failed certain test cases. For example, in sample 2, after the third step, the code's B state is s=179. When processing the fourth element (179), which is equal to s, the code should add 2 * cnt to newB[s] (179), but according to the corrected code, this is handled.

Let's re-calculate sample 2 with this corrected transition:

Sample 2:

n=4, a = [179, 1, 1, 179]

Processing first element 179 (non-zero):

newA=0.

newB[179] += 1*3 → newB={179:3}.

Processing second element 1 (non-zero):

newA=0.

newB is built from:

- from A (0 contribution).

- from B entries (s=179):

   new_s =179 ^1=178. newB[178] +=3.

   if s == a_i (1 !=179) → no.

So newB={178:3}.

Processing third element 1 (non-zero):

newA=0.

newB is built from:

- from A (0 contribution).

- from B entries (s=178):

   new_s=178^1=179. newB[179] +=3.

   if s ==1 → 178 !=1 → no.

So newB={179:3}.

Processing fourth element 179 (non-zero):

newA=0.

newB is built from:

- from A (0 contribution).

- from B entries (s=179):

   new_s =179 ^179=0. newB[0] +=3.

   if s ==179 (yes):

       newB[179] +=3 *2 → newB[179] +=6.

Thus, newB entries are:

0:3

179:6.

Thus, newB is {0:3, 179:6}.

Sum is 3+6=9, which matches the sample.

Thus, the corrected code should include the additional check for s == a_i and add 2 * cnt to newB[s].

Thus, the mistake in the original code was missing this transition.

The corrected code should:

For non-zero a_i:

   newA = 0

   newB is built from:

      transitions from A to B with s=a_i.

      transitions from B to B by assigning to the third variable (new_s = s^a_i).

      transitions from B by assigning to an equal variable, which is valid only if s == a_i, and then adding 2 * cnt to newB[s].

Thus, the code should be modified as follows:

In the code's processing of non-zero elements:

newA = 0

newB = defaultdict(int)

if dpA > 0:

    newB[num] = (newB[num] + dpA *3) % MOD

for s, cnt in dpB.items():

    new_s = s ^ num

    newB[new_s] = (newB[new_s] + cnt) % MOD

    if s == num:

        newB[s] = (newB[s] + 2 * cnt) % MOD

Thus, adding the check for s == num and adding 2*cnt to newB[s].

This is the correct approach.

The original code did not include the last step (checking s == num and adding 2*cnt), which caused the incorrect results.

Thus, the code needs to be modified to include this check.

With this correction, the code should now pass all test cases.
