Okay, let's see. The problem is to find, for each vertex u, the minimum coins needed to reconnect the tree after removing u. The demo input gives a specific output, but the code provided isn't handling it correctly. So, where's the mistake?

Hmm. Let's recap the problem. When a vertex u is removed, the tree splits into k components where k is the degree of u. To connect them, we need k-1 edges. Each new edge connects two components. For each edge added, we pay the sum of the two vertices' current weights, and then those weights are increased by 1. The cost is cumulative. Wait, but the way the problem is described, each operation involves adding an edge and then increasing the weights of the two vertices used. So, the next time those vertices are used, their weights are higher.

So, the key is that each time we select a vertex, its weight increases, so we want to minimize the number of times a vertex is chosen. For example, if a vertex is used in multiple edges, each subsequent use costs more. Therefore, the optimal strategy would be to use each vertex as few times as possible. But how?

Wait, the minimum total coins would require choosing 2*(k-1) vertices (since each edge uses two), but each edge uses two distinct vertices. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to select the 2*(k-1) smallest weights from all the remaining nodes (excluding u), but ensuring that each is used as few times as possible. But since each edge uses two different nodes, perhaps we can model this as selecting the smallest m=2*(k-1) nodes, sum their weights, and then add the sum of the number of times each is used multiplied by the increment steps. Wait, no, because each time a node is used, its weight increases by 1. So if a node is used t times, the total contribution from that node is w_i + (w_i +1) + ... + (w_i + t-1). Which is equivalent to t*w_i + t*(t-1)/2.

But that's complicated. So the problem requires that when you select nodes for edges, each selection of a node in an edge increases its weight for subsequent uses. So the order in which the edges are added matters. However, to minimize the total cost, we need to use each node as few times as possible. So the minimal total cost would be achieved by using the smallest possible weights, but also using each of them as few times as possible.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think: in order to create k-1 edges, each edge uses two nodes. The minimal cost would be to pick the 2*(k-1) nodes with the smallest weights, and each node is used exactly once. Because that way, each node's weight is only increased once, so their initial weight is added once. For example, if you have to create two edges (k-1=2), you need four nodes. If each is used once, the cost is sum of their initial weights plus 0 (since each is used once, the increment happens after the cost is paid). Wait, no. Because when you add an edge between u and v, you pay w_u + w_v, then increase each by 1. So the order in which edges are added doesn't affect the total cost for that node. For example, using a node in two edges would cost w_i for the first edge and (w_i +1) for the second. So the total for two uses is 2*w_i +1. Similarly, for three uses, it's 3*w_i +3 (1+2). So the total cost for a node used t times is t*w_i + t*(t-1)/2.

Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting 2*(k-1) nodes (since each edge contributes two), allowing repeats (since a node can be in multiple edges), such that the sum of (w_i * t_i) + (t_i choose 2) for all nodes i is minimized, where t_i is the number of times node i is used, and the sum of all t_i is 2*(k-1). But this is a more complex optimization problem.

But how can we model this? Let's think of the optimal way to choose the nodes. Since the cost increases quadratically with the number of uses, it's better to spread out the uses as much as possible. The minimal total cost is achieved by using the smallest available weights as much as possible, but not overusing any one node.

Wait, but in the initial approach, the code simply selects the first 2*(k-1) smallest weights (excluding u) and sums them. However, this approach does not account for the fact that using a node multiple times increases the cost each time. For example, if a node is used twice, the first time contributes w_i, the second contributes w_i +1. So the total for two uses is 2w_i +1, which is more than if two different nodes with w_i and w_j (where w_j is w_i +1) were used. So the initial approach's assumption that the sum is the sum of the first 2*(k-1) elements is incorrect. Because using the same node multiple times adds an extra cost.

Therefore, the correct approach is to select the 2*(k-1) nodes in such a way that each is used once if possible. If 2*(k-1) is even, then all uses are once. But if there's an odd number, then one node is used twice. But how?

Wait, no. Each edge requires two nodes. So for (k-1) edges, we need exactly 2*(k-1) node usages. For example, for two edges, four usages. So if we can choose four different nodes, that's best. If not, like three edges (six usages) but only five nodes available, then some nodes must be used twice. But since the problem allows using the same node multiple times, but each time the cost increases.

But the initial approach of taking the smallest 2*(k-1) nodes and summing them would be the same as using each once. However, in reality, if we can't use each once (because there are not enough nodes), then some nodes are used more, leading to higher cost.

So the minimal cost would be the sum of the smallest s nodes multiplied by their use count plus the sum of the (t_i choose 2) for each node. But how to compute this?

Alternatively, the minimal total cost is achieved by selecting the m = 2*(k-1) smallest weights (excluding u), and for each weight, the cost is w_i + (w_i +1) + ... + (w_i + (t_i -1)), where t_i is the number of times the node is used. However, this depends on the order in which we select the nodes. For example, using a node twice would cost 2w_i + 1, while using two different nodes with w_i and w_j (where w_j >= w_i) would cost w_i + w_j. If w_j >= w_i + 1, then using the same node twice is better than using two different nodes. Wait, for example, w_i = 1. Using the node twice: 1 + 2 = 3. Using two nodes with 1 and 2: 1+2=3. So same cost. But if the next node is 2, then using same node is better. Wait, but in the problem, the nodes are not being 'used up'; you can use a node multiple times, but each time after the first, its weight is higher.

So, the optimal way is to take the first m smallest weights, and for each of them, count how many times they are selected. Then compute the sum of their initial weights multiplied by the number of times they are used, plus the sum of (t_i choose 2).

For example, if you have to select 3 times (m=3), and the smallest three weights are [1,1,1], then each is used once. The sum is 1+1+1 =3. Plus (0+0+0) =0. Total 3.

But if you select a node twice, then for example, m=3, and the smallest three are [1,1,2], then using two of the 1's and one 2 would cost 1 +1 +2 =4, plus (1 choose 2) for the first 1 (since used once) and (1 choose 2) for the second 1 (used once), and (0) for the 2. But that's not right. Wait, the sum of (t_i choose 2) is (1 choose 2) for each t_i. So for two uses of 1, but t_i is 2. (2 choose 2) is 1. So the total cost would be (1+1+1) [sum of their uses] + (1) [sum of t_i choose 2]. So total 3 +1=4. Alternatively, if the three usages are two from the first 1 and one from the second 1, the sum of t_i choose 2 is (2 choose 2) + (1 choose 2) = 1 +0 =1. So same result.

Alternatively, if we have three uses: two from the first 1 and one from the second 1. The sum would be 1+1 (first two uses) +1 (third use) = 3. Then the sum of t_i choose 2 is (2 choose 2) + (1 choose 2) =1. So total 4.

Alternatively, if we take three uses of the first 1: that's t_i=3. Sum of w_i * t_i =1*3=3. Sum of (3 choose 2)=3. Total 6. Which is worse.

So the optimal way is to use the smallest possible nodes and spread the uses as much as possible.

So, the correct approach is to select the first m smallest weights (sorted), and for each occurrence in the sorted list (including duplicates), compute the sum. Each occurrence represents a use, and each use after the first on a node adds 1 to the cost (since the first use is w_i, second is w_i+1, etc).

Wait, but each occurrence in the sorted list is a node. Wait, no. The sorted list may have multiple nodes with the same weight. For example, in the demo input, all weights are 1. So sorted_w_excluding[u] (for u=1) is [1,1,1,1,1]. When k-1=2 (since degree of u=2?), so m=2*(k-1) = 4. So we take the first 4 elements. Each is 1, sum is 4. But according to the demo output, when u=2, the answer is 4. That matches.

But according to the code, when u is 1, the code's output would be 4. But in the demo input, the output for u=1 is 4. Which matches. But the demo output shows that when u is 1, the answer is 4, which is correct.

Wait, but the demo input is:

6
1 1 1 1 1 1
Edges form a tree where node 1 is connected to 2,3,4. Node 2 is connected to 5 and 6.

When u=1 is removed, the tree splits into 3 components: those connected to 2, 3, 4. So k=3 (degree of u=1 is 3), so we need 3-1=2 edges. So m=2*2=4. The sum of the 4 smallest nodes (excluding u=1). The nodes are 2,3,4,5,6. All have w=1. So sum is 4*1=4. Which matches the demo output.

So the code's approach seems to work here. But wait, the code's approach is to take the first m elements and sum them, but in reality, the cost would be higher because each subsequent use of a node increases the cost.

Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, when you use a node in an edge, you pay its current weight, then increment it. So the first use is w_i, second use (if same node) is w_i +1, third use is w_i+2, etc.

So for example, if m=4 and all nodes are 1:

If we use four different nodes, each once. The cost is 1+1+1+1=4. But each use is once. So sum is 4. Then, each node's weight is increased once, but that's after the operation. The problem asks for the coins paid, which is the sum of their current weights at the time of adding the edge.

In this case, all uses are first time. So the code's approach of summing the first m elements is correct.

But if the nodes used are some multiple times, then the sum would be higher. For example, if we use two nodes twice each. Then the cost would be 1 + (1+1) for the first node, and 1 + (1+1) for the second. Total 1+2 +1+2 =6. Which is worse than using four different nodes (sum 4).

Therefore, the optimal approach is to use as many different nodes as possible, each once, and only when necessary to reuse nodes. So the minimal sum is indeed the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list, because each use is first for the node. So the code's approach is correct for the demo input.

But the sample output for u=3 is 0. Let's see why. When u=3 is removed, the degree is 1 (since it's connected only to 1). So k=1. So k-1=0 edges needed. So the answer is 0. Which matches the code.

But why does the code have a condition where if k <=1, print 0. That's correct. Because when the node's degree is 0 (but the tree can't have a node with degree 0 except if n=1, but n>=2 here) or 1, removing it splits into k=1 components. So no edges needed.

So why is the code's approach correct here? Because when the degree is k, you need k-1 edges. Each edge uses two nodes, but the code is summing 2*(k-1) smallest nodes. Wait, no. Wait, the code says m = 2*(k-1), then takes the first m elements and sums them. But each edge requires two nodes, so for k-1 edges, you need 2*(k-1) nodes. So each edge uses two distinct nodes. Wait, but why?

Wait, for example, if you have 3 components, you need two edges. Each edge connects two components. The optimal way is to connect them in a chain. So each edge uses one node from each component. So for each edge, two nodes are used. So total of 2*(k-1) nodes. So the code's approach of selecting 2*(k-1) nodes (each once) and summing their initial weights is correct. Because each node is used once, so the cost is the sum of their initial weights. Then, after adding edges, their weights are increased by 1, but that doesn't affect the cost calculation.

So the code is correct. But then why does the user say the code doesn't pass the sample? Let's check the sample input again.

Sample Input:

6
1 1 1 1 1 1
Edges:
1-2
1-3
1-4
2-5
2-6

So the tree structure is:

1 is connected to 2,3,4.

2 is connected to 5,6.

For u=1, when it's removed, the tree splits into three components: [2 and its children 5,6], [3], [4]. So k=3, so we need 2 edges. So m=2*2=4. The available nodes are 2,3,4,5,6. All have w=1. Summing four 1's gives 4, which is correct.

For u=2, removing it splits into two components: [1,3,4], and [5], [6]. So k=3 (since node 2's edges are to 1,5,6). So m=2*(3-1)=4. Available nodes are 1,3,4,5,6. Summing four 1's: 4.

So the code's approach gives the correct answer for u=1 and u=2.

For u=3, removing it splits into 1 component (since u=3 has degree 1). So no edges needed. Output is 0.

So the code works for the sample. But the user says that the output is not passing all samples. Hmm. Maybe the code is not handling the case when the sum of m exceeds the available nodes.

Wait, for example, if the tree after removing u has more components than possible to select nodes from. But the code checks if m exceeds the length of arr (sorted_w_excluding). But sorted_w_excluding[u-1] is a list of all nodes except u, sorted. So the length is n-1. Since m is 2*(k-1), and k is the degree of u. The maximum degree of a node in a tree is up to n-1 (a star-shaped tree). For example, in a star with center u, degree is n-1. Then, m=2*(n-2). But the available nodes are n-1. So 2*(n-2) could be larger than n-1 when n-1 is small. For example, if n=3, u has degree 2, then m=2*(2-1)=2. The available nodes are 2 (n-1=2). So 2 <=2. So code is okay. But for n=4, u with degree 3: m=2*(3-1)=4. available nodes are 3. So m=4>3. Then the code prints 0? But that's impossible.

Wait, but in a tree, a node can't have a degree higher than the number of other nodes. So for a node u with degree k, after removing it, there are k components. The number of edges needed to connect them is k-1. Each edge requires two nodes. So the total nodes required is 2*(k-1). But the number of available nodes (excluding u) is n-1. So 2*(k-1) must be <=n-1. Because k is the degree of u, which is <=n-1. For example, if u is a node with degree n-1 (like the center of a star), then m=2*(n-2). But n-1 >= m?

Wait 2*(n-2) <=n-1 ?

2n-4 <=n-1

n <=3.

So for n>3, this would not hold. For example, n=4, 2*(4-2) =4. n-1=3. 4>3. So the code would print 0, but this is a problem.

But such a tree structure isn't possible. Because in a star-shaped tree, a node with degree n-1 has edges to all other nodes. So when you remove u, you have n-1 components (each a single node). To connect them, you need (n-1 -1) =n-2 edges. Each edge uses two nodes. So 2*(n-2) node usages. But there are only n-1 nodes available. So each must be used at least once, and some must be used twice. So in this case, the code's approach would fail.

But wait, how can the code handle such cases?

In the code, when u is removed, the sorted_w_excluding[u-1] is a list of all nodes except u. For example, if u has degree n-1 (star), then after removing u, the tree splits into n-1 components (each a single node). So k-1 = n-2 edges are needed. Each edge uses two nodes. So 2*(n-2) nodes are needed. But the available nodes are n-1. So 2*(n-2) = 2n-4. For n=4, this is 4. available nodes are 3. So 2n-4=4, but available nodes are 3. So m=4, but the sorted_w_excluding list has length 3. So the code's condition if m> len(arr) would trigger and output 0, which is incorrect.

But in reality, this case is possible. For example, when u is the center of a star. The code would output 0, but the correct answer is sum of 2*(k-1) nodes, but how?

So the code's approach is flawed in such cases.

Ah! So the code's mistake is that in the case when 2*(k-1) exceeds the number of available nodes (n-1), which can happen when the degree of u is large (k is large), then the code prints 0, but that's incorrect.

For example, in the star-shaped tree where u has degree 4 (n=5 nodes). Then, when u is removed, the tree splits into 4 components. So k=4. So k-1=3 edges needed. m=2*3=6. But available nodes are 4. So 6>4. The code would print 0, but the correct answer requires using the 4 nodes multiple times.

In this case, the minimal cost would be:

Each edge requires two nodes. So for 3 edges, 6 node usages. But only 4 nodes are available. So some nodes must be used more than once.

How to compute the minimal sum here?

Each usage of a node increases its cost. So for example, using node a three times: cost is a's initial weight *3 + 0+1+2 (since each use increments by 1). The total for three uses is 3w_a +3.

So the minimal cost would be to use the nodes with the smallest weights as many times as possible.

For example, if all nodes have weight 1. Then, the sum would be:

We need 6 usages. 4 nodes. So each node is used once (4 usages), then two more usages. So two nodes are used twice each.

The sum would be:

Each of the two nodes used twice: 1 + (1+1) = 3 each. The other two nodes are used once: 1 each.

Total sum: 3+3 +1 +1= 8.

Alternatively, if the nodes are all 1, sum is 1*6 + sum of (t_i choose 2) for all i.

The total t_i's sum to 6. The minimal sum of (t_i choose 2) is achieved when the t_i are as balanced as possible.

In this case, two nodes used twice (t=2) and two nodes used once (t=1). So sum of (2C2) + (2C2) + (1C2) + (1C2) ) = 1 +1 +0 +0 = 2. So total cost is 6*1 + 2 = 8.

So the code's approach, which sums the first 6 nodes (but there are only 4 available) would print 0, but the correct answer is 8.

So the code's approach is incorrect in such cases.

Therefore, the code needs to be adjusted to handle scenarios where 2*(k-1) exceeds the number of available nodes (n-1), which is possible when the degree of u is large.

But how?

This indicates that the initial approach of selecting the first m=2*(k-1) nodes is incorrect when m exceeds n-1. Because you have to reuse nodes, which increases the cost.

So the correct approach must account for the fact that when m exceeds the number of available nodes, some nodes are used multiple times, leading to higher costs.

This means that the code's approach is wrong. The original code is incorrect in cases where m is larger than the number of available nodes (n-1).

So the code needs to be revised to handle such cases. The key is to compute the sum of the minimal possible costs considering that some nodes may have to be used multiple times.

But how can this be done efficiently?

An alternative approach would be to calculate the sum as the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list, plus the number of times each element is used beyond the first. For example, for the first s elements (s <= m), each can be used once, and the remaining (m - s) times are distributed as additional uses on the smallest elements.

But how to model this?

Let's think about the general case:

We have a sorted list of weights (excluding u) in ascending order: w_1 <= w_2 <= ... <= w_{n-1}.

We need to select m=2*(k-1) uses, which may involve reusing some nodes.

The minimal sum is achieved by using the smallest possible nodes as much as possible. So the optimal way is to use the first t nodes each once, and then the remaining (m - t) uses are spread on the first few nodes, each used as many times as possible.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's think of the sum as follows:

Each node's usage contributes w_i * t_i + (t_i choose 2), where t_i is the number of times it's used.

The total sum is sum(w_i * t_i) + sum( t_i*(t_i -1)/2 ).

The goal is to minimize this sum, given that sum(t_i) = m.

To minimize this, the optimal strategy is to assign t_i as evenly as possible. Because when t_i is larger, the (t_i choose 2) term increases quadratically, which should be avoided. So, distributing the usages as evenly as possible among the smallest weights is optimal.

Alternatively, it's better to have as many nodes as possible with t_i=1, then the remaining usages assigned to the smallest nodes.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Another approach is to realize that the minimal sum is sum_{i=1 to m} w_i + sum_{i=1 to (m - s)} (i-1), where s is the number of nodes available. Because the first s nodes are used once (sum w_i for s nodes), then the remaining (m - s) usages are additional uses of the first (m - s) nodes, each contributing an incrementing cost.

For example, if m=6 and s=4:

The first 4 uses are of each node once (sum 4*1=4). The remaining 2 uses are the first two nodes again. The cost for these would be 1 (for the first node's second use) and 1 (for the second node's second use). So sum is 4 + 1 + 1 =6. Plus the (t_i choose 2) terms: two nodes have t_i=2 (each contribute 1), others t_i=1. So sum of (1+1) =2. Total cost is 6+2=8.

So the sum of the first m elements (4 in the first part, 2 in the second) plus the sum of (t_i choose 2) is 4+2 + (1+1) =8.

But how to calculate this?

The sum of the first m elements is the same as the initial approach (summing the sorted list up to m elements). But when m exceeds the number of nodes available (s), the remaining (m - s) elements are the same as the first (m - s) elements of the sorted list.

So for example, if the sorted list is [1,1,1,1], and m=6, then the sum is 1+1+1+1 +1+1 (but the first 4 are used once, the next two are the first two elements again). So the sum of their w_i's is 6*1=6. Then, the sum of t_i choose 2 is (2 choose 2) for the first two elements (used twice each) and the rest used once. So sum is 1+1=2. Total 6+2=8.

So the sum of the first m elements (even if m exceeds the number of nodes) is sum of the sorted list's elements, each taken as the sorted list's elements cycled. So the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list (including repeats) is sum(w_sorted[i] for i in 0..m-1], where the list is considered to repeat when i exceeds the length.

But how to compute this?

For example, if the sorted list is [a, b, c], and m=5. Then the elements are a, b, c, a, b.

Sum is a +b +c +a +b = 2a + 2b +c.

So the sum can be calculated as:

- q = m // s (number of full cycles)
- r = m % s (remaining elements after full cycles)
- sum = q * sum(sorted_list) + sum(sorted_list[:r])

So for m=5, s=3:

q=1 (5//3=1), r=2.

sum =1*(a+b+c) + (a +b) = 2a +2b +c.

Yes.

So the sum of the first m elements (including repeats) can be computed as q * sum(sorted_list) + sum of the first r elements.

Then, the sum of (t_i choose 2) for all nodes is sum( (t_i * (t_i -1)) // 2 ), where t_i is the number of times each node is used.

Each node is used q times for the first r nodes, and q-1 times for the remaining (s - r) nodes.

Wait, for example:

sorted_list has s elements. m = q*s + r.

Each element in the first r positions is used q+1 times. Each element in the remaining s -r positions is used q times.

So the sum of (t_i choose 2) is:

r * ((q+1)*q//2) + (s - r) * (q*(q-1)//2).

So the total cost is:

sum_of_m_elements = q * sum(sorted_list) + sum(sorted_list[:r])

plus

sum_of_t_choose_2 = r * (q*(q+1)//2) + (s - r) * (q*(q-1)//2).

Therefore, the code needs to compute this.

But how to implement this efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e6?

Let's outline the steps for each u:

1. For the current u, compute k = degree of u. If k <=1, answer is 0.

2. Else, m = 2*(k-1).

3. Get the sorted list of weights of all nodes except u, sorted in non-decreasing order. Let s be the length of this list (which is n-1).

4. If m > s:

   a. Compute q = m // s, r = m % s.

   b. sum_elements = q * sum(sorted_list) + sum(sorted_list[:r])

   c. sum_choose = r * (q * (q + 1) // 2) + (s - r) * (q * (q -1) //2)

   d. total = sum_elements + sum_choose

5. Else:

   a. sum_elements = sum(sorted_list[:m])

   b. sum_choose =0, since each node is used once.

   c. total = sum_elements

So the code needs to be modified to handle cases where m exceeds the length of the sorted list.

But for large n (up to 1e6), precomputing the sorted list for each u is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Ah, here's the problem! The original code precomputes sorted_w_excluding for each u, which is O(n^2) time and space. For n=1e6, this is impossible. The code would not even run for n=1e6, as storing 1e6 lists, each of size 1e6, is 1e12 elements. That's impossible.

So the original code is incorrect for the problem's constraints. It's O(n^2) in both time and space, which is not feasible for n=1e6.

The mistake here is that the initial approach precomputes sorted_w_excluding for each u, which is not feasible. So the code's approach is incorrect for the problem's constraints.

This is a major problem. So the original code is wrong for two reasons: it doesn't handle cases where m exceeds the number of nodes, and it's not feasible for the input size.

Therefore, we need a completely different approach that can handle the problem within the time and memory constraints.

Alternative approach:

The key insight is that for each u, when it's removed, the required m is 2*(k-1), where k is the degree of u. The minimal cost is the sum of the smallest m weights (possibly reusing them) plus the sum of (t_i choose 2) for each node's usage count.

But the sorted list for each u is all nodes except u, sorted by weight. However, precomputing these sorted lists is not feasible for large n.

So we need a way to quickly compute, for each u, the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list of all nodes except u, and also compute the sum_choose part.

But how?

Let's consider that the global sorted list of all nodes is available. For each u, the sorted list is the global list with u removed.

If the global list is sorted as S = sorted(w_i for all nodes), then for each u, the sorted list excluding u can be obtained by finding the positions where u's weight is present and removing one occurrence.

But this is not straightforward, especially if multiple nodes have the same weight.

Alternatively, for each u, the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list (excluding u) can be computed as follows:

- The sum of the global sorted list's first m+1 elements, but subtract the value of u if it's among them.

But this is not exactly correct. For example, if u is not in the first m+1 elements of the global list, then the sum of the first m elements (excluding u) would be the same as the sum of the global list's first m elements if u is not in them.

But this approach is not precise.

Alternatively, we can precompute prefix sums for the global sorted list. Then, for each u, find the number of nodes with weight <= w_u, and adjust accordingly.

But this seems complicated.

Another approach: since the problem requires the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list (excluding u), for each u. Let's precompute the global sorted list and its prefix sums.

For each u, the sorted list excluding u is the same as the global list, but with one occurrence of u's weight removed. So if we have the global list sorted, the sum can be computed as the sum of the first m elements in the global list, but possibly excluding u's contribution if it's among those first m elements.

But this requires knowing how many times u's weight appears in the first m elements of the global list.

Let me think. Let the global sorted list be S. Let w_u be the weight of u. Let the number of elements in S with value < w_u be a, the number of elements equal to w_u be b. So S has a elements before w_u and b elements of w_u.

When we exclude u, the new sorted list has a + (b-1) elements with value <= w_u, followed by the rest.

So for each u, the sorted list excluding u is formed by removing one occurrence of w_u from S.

Now, to compute the sum of the first m elements in S excluding u:

If in the global S, the first m elements include some elements of w_u, then removing one of them might reduce the sum. Otherwise, the sum remains the same.

So for example, in the global S, the sum of the first m elements is sum_S_m. For u, if u's weight is in the first m elements of S, then the sum of the first m elements in S excluding u is sum_S_m minus w_u. If u is not in the first m elements, then the sum is sum_S_m.

But this isn't correct if there are multiple elements with the same weight as u in the first m elements.

For example, if S has elements [1,1,1,2,3], and m=3. sum_S_m =3. For u with w_u=1, there are three 1's. Excluding u, the sum becomes 1+1+2=4. But sum_S_m is 3. So subtracting one 1 gives 3-1=2, which is incorrect.

Ah, so the problem is that there are multiple instances of w_u in the first m elements. So how many instances of w_u are in the first m elements of the global S?

Let's say there are c instances of w_u in the first m elements. Then, the sum of the first m elements excluding u is sum_S_m - w_u if c >=1.

But how to compute c?

We can find the number of elements <= w_u in the first m elements, and the number of elements < w_u. The difference is the count of elements equal to w_u in the first m elements.

Let's proceed step by step.

For each u:

1. Compute the sum of the first m elements in the global sorted list (sum_S_m).

2. Compute how many elements in the first m elements of S are equal to w_u. Let this be cnt.

3. If cnt >=1, then the sum excluding u is sum_S_m - w_u.

4. Else, the sum excluding u is sum_S_m.

But this is not accurate. Because the global list may have multiple elements equal to w_u. When we exclude u, the new list's first m elements could have one less element of w_u, but if there were multiple, the sum would decrease by w_u.

But how to compute whether u's element is included in the first m elements of S?

Alternatively, the sum of the first m elements in S excluding u is equal to:

sum_S_m if u's position in the global sorted list is after the m-th element.

sum_S_m - w_u if u's position in the global sorted list is among the first m elements.

But this is only true if there are multiple occurrences of w_u in the first m elements.

Wait, but the global sorted list includes all nodes, including u. So when we exclude u, the list is S without one occurrence of w_u.

But the original S may have multiple occurrences of w_u, so the first m elements in the new list could be the same as in S, minus one occurrence of w_u if it was in the first m.

For example, S is [1,1,1,2,3], m=3. Original sum is 3. Excluding u (w_u=1), the new list is [1,1,2,3]. The first 3 elements are 1,1,2. Sum is 4. So the original sum was 3, minus 1 (the u's element) gives 2, which is not correct. So the approach of subtracting w_u is incorrect.

Therefore, this approach is not correct.

Another Idea:

The sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u is equal to the sum of the first m elements in the original sorted list, but if u is among those elements, we subtract w_u and possibly include the next element after the first m.

But this depends on how many times u's weight appears in the first m elements.

This is getting too complicated.

Alternative Plan:

Given the time constraints, perhaps the problem can be solved by precomputing the global sorted list and prefix sums. Then, for each u, the sorted list excluding u is almost the same as the global list, but missing one instance of w_u. So when we need to take m elements from this list:

- If the global list's first m elements contain at least one occurrence of w_u, then the sum of the first m elements excluding u is sum_S_m minus w_u.

- Otherwise, the sum is sum_S_m.

But this would be correct only if there's at least one occurrence of w_u in the first m elements of the global list. But that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, when u is in the first m elements of the global list, the sum is sum_S_m - w_u. Otherwise, it's sum_S_m.

But this is only correct if there's exactly one occurrence of w_u in the first m elements. For multiple occurrences, it's not correct.

So this approach is not correct, but it's a possible approximation.

But in the case where there are multiple occurrences of w_u in the first m elements, this approach would subtract w_u once, but the actual sum would be sum_S_m - w_u (since the new list's first m elements would have one less w_u).

For example, S = [1,1,1], m=3. sum_S_m =3. For u with w_u=1, the new list has [1,1], and the sum of the first 3 elements (but there are only 2) would need to be handled as per the m > s case.

But this seems to indicate that this approach is not viable.

Therefore, given the time and space constraints, perhaps the correct way to handle this problem is to precompute the global sorted list and for each u, compute how many of its elements are in the first (m) of the global list, but this seems challenging.

Alternative Idea:

Instead of trying to handle the sorted list for each u, perhaps we can realize that the optimal selection for the sorted list excluding u is the same as the global sorted list with u's weight removed once. So for the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u:

- If the global sorted list has enough elements (after removing u) to cover m elements, then the sum is the sum of the first m elements in the global sorted list where u's weight is possibly excluded.

But again, this requires knowing how many times u's weight appears in the first m + t elements of the global list.

At this point, given time constraints and the problem's difficulty, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following steps:

1. Sort all nodes by their weight in ascending order, and compute the prefix sum.

2. For each u, compute the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u, where m=2*(degree[u]-1). Also compute the sum_choose part if m exceeds the number of available nodes (n-1).

But how to compute this efficiently?

An alternative approach is to precompute the sorted list and for each u, determine:

a. The sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u.

b. The number of elements in the sorted list excluding u (which is n-1).

c. If m > n-1, then compute the sum and sum_choose as per the q and r formula.

But the main challenge is to compute the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u.

To compute this, we can note that the sorted list excluding u is the same as the global list with one occurrence of u's weight removed.

So, for each u, the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u can be computed as follows:

- Count how many elements in the global list are less than w_u: let's call this count 'less'.

- Count how many elements are equal to w_u: 'eq'.

- The sorted list excluding u will have:

   - All elements less than w_u.

   - (eq -1) elements equal to w_u.

   - All elements greater than w_u.

So the position of u in the global sorted list is between 'less' and 'less + eq -1' in the new list.

To find the sum of the first m elements in the new list:

If m <= less + (eq -1) + ... (elements after w_u are not needed), then the sum is the same as the sum of the first m elements in the global list, unless one of those elements is u.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternative Plan:

Given the time constraints and the problem's difficulty, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute the global sorted list and its prefix sum. Then, for each u:

1. Compute the number of elements in the sorted list excluding u that are less than w_u: this is 'less' count.

2. The number of elements equal to w_u in the sorted list excluding u is 'eq_count = count_global[w_u] -1'.

3. The first part of the sorted list excluding u is:

   a. All elements with value < w_u.

   b. 'eq_count' elements with value == w_u.

   c. Elements with value > w_u.

The sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u can be computed as follows:

- If m <= less: sum is prefix_sum[m].

- If m <= less + eq_count: sum is prefix_sum[less] + (m - less) * w_u.

- Else: sum is prefix_sum[less] + eq_count * w_u + (prefix_sum[less + count_global[w_u]] - prefix_sum[less + count_global[w_u]]) ... wait, this is not correct.

Alternatively, the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u can be determined by:

sum = sum of the first (less + eq_count + (m - (less + eq_count))) elements from the global list, but ensuring that one occurrence of w_u is excluded.

But I'm stuck.

Given the time constraints and the problem's difficulty, perhaps the correct approach is to use a binary search for each u to determine how many elements in the global sorted list are less than or equal to w_u, and then adjust the sum accordingly.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, given the problem's time constraints and the original code's incorrect approach, perhaps the correct code should precompute the global sorted list and use that, then for each u, compute m=2*(degree[u]-1), and compute the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u, but handle the case when m exceeds the available nodes by using the formula for q and r, as previously discussed.

But how to compute the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u?

An alternative idea: for each u, the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u is equal to the sum of the first m elements in the global list, but subtract w_u if u is among the first m elements in the global list.

But this is not correct if the global list has multiple elements of w_u in the first m positions.

For example, if the global list is [1,1,1], and u is one of the 1's, then the sum of the first 3 elements excluding u is 1+1=2. The global sum is 3, subtract 1 gives 2. So it works.

In this case, the approach works.

Another example: global list is [1,1,2,3], m=3. u is one of the 1's. The global sum is 4. Excluding u, the sum is 1+2+3=6. But according to the approach, subtract 1 from the global sum of the first 3 elements (1+1+2=4), giving 3. Which is incorrect.

So this approach is not correct.

Therefore, this indicates that the problem is more complex and requires a different approach.

Given the time constraints and the problem's complexity, perhaps the correct code should handle the cases where m exceeds the available nodes by using the formula for q and r, but also precompute the global sorted list and its prefix sums.

But given the original code's approach is not feasible for large n due to O(n^2) time and space, a new approach is needed.

Revised Plan:

The correct approach involves the following steps:

1. Precompute the global sorted list of weights and its prefix sum.

2. For each node u:

   a. Compute m = 2*(degree[u] - 1).

   b. If degree[u] <=1, the answer is 0.

   c. Else:

      i. Compute s = n-1.

      ii. If m ==0: answer is 0.

      iii. Else:

         A. Compute the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u.

         B. Compute the sum_choose part based on whether m exceeds s.

But the challenge is step A. To compute this sum efficiently.

Alternative Idea:

The sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u can be computed as the sum of the first m elements in the global list, plus some adjustment if u is among those elements.

But the adjustment is to exclude one occurrence of u's weight.

So for each u:

count_global = number of elements in the global list with weight <= w_u.

count_global is the first position where elements are greater than w_u.

But we need to find how many of the first m elements in the global list are < w_u, and how many are == w_u.

Let:

low = number of elements < w_u.

eq = number of elements == w_u.

So, in the global list, the first low elements are < w_u, next eq elements are == w_u.

In the list excluding u, the first low elements are < w_u, next (eq-1) elements are == w_u.

So, the sum of the first m elements in the new list can be computed as:

if m <= low:

   sum = prefix_sum[m]

elif m <= low + (eq-1):

   sum = prefix_sum[low] + (m - low) * w_u

else:

   sum = prefix_sum[low] + (eq-1)*w_u + (prefix_sum[low + eq + (m - (low + eq -1))] - prefix_sum[low + eq])

But this is not accurate, as the elements after low + eq are also present.

Alternatively:

The sum in the new list is the same as the sum in the global list, but with one occurrence of w_u removed from the first part where possible.

If the new list has enough elements to cover m elements, then:

The sum is prefix_sum_global[m] - (if there is at least one occurrence of w_u in the first m elements of the global list).

But how to compute this.

Let's compute:

In the global list, the number of elements <= w_u up to the m-th position is min(find the number of elements <= w_u in the global list, m).

If there are any elements == w_u in the first m elements of the global list, then the sum is prefix_sum_global[m] - w_u.

Else, the sum is prefix_sum_global[m].

But this is only correct if there's exactly one occurrence of w_u in the first m elements. For multiple occurrences, this would over-subtract.

For example, global list [1,1,1], m=3, u's weight is 1.

The sum in the new list is 1+1=2. The global sum is 3. Subtracting 1 gives 2, which is correct.

If global list [1,1,1,2,2], m=4, u's weight is 1:

Global sum of first 4 elements is 1+1+1+2=5. New list sum is 1+1+2+2=6. But according to the approach, subtract 1, gives 5-1=4, which is incorrect.

So the approach is not correct.

This suggests that this problem is more complex and requires a different approach.

Alternative Idea:

The sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u can be computed as follows:

We need to select the m smallest elements from all nodes except u.

These elements are the same as the global sorted list's m smallest elements, but excluding u.

So the sum is the sum of the global sorted list's first (m + 1) elements, minus u's weight if it is among them. But how to determine the correct number.

This is not straightforward.

Given the time constraints and the complexity of this problem, perhaps the correct approach is to use a binary search for each u to find how many elements are in the global list less than or equal to w_u, and then compute the sum accordingly.

But I'm not confident.

Given the time constraints and the original code's issues, perhaps the correct code should:

- For each u, compute the sum of the first m elements in the global sorted list.

- Then, if u is in the first m elements, subtract w_u once.

- Then, if m exceeds the number of available nodes (n-1), compute the sum_choose part.

But even this approach is not correct for all cases.

In the demo input, all weights are 1. For u=1, m=4. The global sorted list includes u=1, so the sum of first 4 elements is 4*1=4. But the new list excludes u=1, so the first 4 elements are [1,1,1,1]. sum is 4. According to the approach: global sum is 4, but since u is in the first 4 elements, subtract 1, sum is 3. Which is incorrect. But the correct sum is 4.

So this approach is wrong.

Therefore, the correct approach must account for the fact that the global list includes u, and the new list excludes u. Thus, the sum of the first m elements in the new list is not simply the sum of the global's first m elements minus w_u if present.

At this point, given the time constraints, I think the original code's approach is incorrect for large n due to O(n^2) time and space, and also the case where m exceeds the number of available nodes.

A correct approach must:

- Precompute the global sorted list and prefix sums.

- For each u, compute m=2*(k-1), and:

   a. If m > n-1, compute sum_elements and sum_choose as per the q and r formula.

   b. Else, compute sum_elements as the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u.

But how to compute (b) efficiently.

The correct way to compute (b) is to determine the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u. This can be done by finding the sum of the first m elements in the global list, and then subtract u's weight if it is among the first m elements of the global list and there are other elements with the same weight.

But this requires knowing how many times u's weight appears in the first m elements of the global list.

Let's proceed with code that uses the global sorted list and prefix sums. For each u:

1. Compute the global sorted list and its prefix sums.

2. For each u, find the indices in the global list where the elements are equal to w_u.

3. The sum of the first m elements in the new list (excluding u) is:

   sum_global = prefix_sum[m]

   count = number of elements in the first m elements of the global list that are equal to w_u.

   if count > 0:

      sum_new = sum_global - w_u

   else:

      sum_new = sum_global

   but this is only correct if there's at least one occurrence of w_u in the first m elements.

   However, if there are multiple occurrences, this subtracts one w_u, which may not be correct.

   For example, if the global list has multiple w_u in the first m elements, and u is one of them, the new list would have one less w_u, so the sum_new should be sum_global - w_u.

   This seems to hold in the demo case.

In the demo case, when u=1 and m=4:

global list is [1,1,1,1,1,1].

sum_global =4.

count is 4.

sum_new =4-1=3.

But the correct sum is 4. So this approach is wrong.

This indicates that the approach is incorrect.

Thus, the correct approach must be more involved.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct code should precompute the global sorted list and prefix sums, and for each u:

- Compute the sum of the first m elements in the global sorted list, but subtracting w_u if the number of elements with value <= w_u in the first m elements is greater than the number of elements with value < w_u.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea:

The sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u is equal to the sum of the first m elements in the global sorted list if u is not in the first m elements. Otherwise, it's the sum of the first m elements in the global list minus w_u, plus the next element after the first m elements (if any), but only if there is an element after.

But this is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sum is the sum of the first m+1 elements in the global list, minus the maximum between u's weight and the (m+1)-th element.

But this is unclear.

Given the time constraints, I think the correct approach is to realize that the initial code's method of precomputing sorted lists for each u is infeasible for large n. Therefore, a new approach is needed that avoids this.

The correct approach should:

- Precompute the global sorted list and prefix sums.

- For each u, compute m = 2*(k-1).

- If m ==0: output 0.

- Else:

   a. Compute the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list excluding u.

   b. Compute the sum_choose part if m > (n-1).

But to compute step a efficiently, we need to find the sum of the first m elements in the sorted list after removing u's one occurrence.

This can be done by:

1. Find the number of elements < w_u in the global list: 'less'.

2. Find the number of elements == w_u in the global list: 'eq'.

3. The new list after excluding u will have 'less' elements < w_u, 'eq-1' elements == w_u, and the rest.

4. The first m elements in the new list can be divided into three parts:

   a. The first 'min(less, m)' elements < w_u.

   b. The next 'max(0, min(eq-1, m - less))' elements == w_u.

   c. The remaining 'max(0, m - less - (eq-1))' elements > w_u.

The sum is the sum of these parts.

But how to compute this quickly?

Let's define:

a = min(less, m)

sum_a = prefix_sum[a]

remaining = m - a

b = min(remaining, eq-1)

sum_b = b * w_u

remaining = m - a - b

sum_c = prefix_sum[less + eq + remaining] - prefix_sum[less + eq]

total_sum = sum_a + sum_b + sum_c

But this requires finding the prefix sums and the counts of elements < and == w_u.

This approach seems feasible.

Steps:

For each u:

1. Compute w_u.

2. Compute less = the number of elements in the global list with value < w_u.

3. Compute eq = the number of elements in the global list with value == w_u.

4. s = n-1 (number of elements in the new list).

5. m = 2*(k-1)

6. If m > s:

   a. Compute q = m // s

   b. r = m % s

   c. sum_elements = q * (sum_global_excluding_u) + sum_new_list[:r]

   d. sum_choose = r * (q*(q+1)//2) + (s - r) * (q*(q-1)//2)

   e. total = sum_elements + sum_choose

7. Else:

   a. Compute a = min(less, m)

   b. remaining = m - a

   c. b = min(remaining, eq-1)

   d. remaining = remaining - b

   e. sum_c = prefix_sum[less + eq + remaining] - prefix_sum[less + eq]

   f. total_sum = prefix_sum[a] + b * w_u + sum_c

   g. sum_choose = 0

   h. total = total_sum

But how to compute sum_global_excluding_u (the sum of the new list)?

sum_global_excluding_u = sum_global - w_u.

Because the new list is the global list with one occurrence of w_u removed.

Therefore, for step 6c:

sum_elements = q * (sum_global - w_u) + sum_new_list[:r]

But how to compute sum_new_list[:r]?

sum_new_list[:r] is computed similarly to step 7:

For r elements in the new list:

a. a = min(less, r)

sum_a = prefix_sum[a]

remaining = r - a

b. min(remaining, eq-1)

sum_b = b * w_u

remaining = remaining - b

sum_c = prefix_sum[less + eq + remaining] - prefix_sum[less + eq]

sum_r = sum_a + sum_b + sum_c

Thus, the code would be:

For each u:

if degree[u] <= 1:

    print(0)

else:

    m = 2*(degree[u]-1)

    s = n-1

    if m ==0:

        print(0)

    elif m > s:

        q = m // s

        r = m % s

        # compute sum_global_excluding_u = sum_global - w_u

        sum_excl = sum_global - w_u

        sum_elements = q * sum_excl

        # compute sum_r for the first r elements in new list

        a = min(less, r)

        sum_a = prefix_sum[a]

        remaining_r = r - a

        b = min(remaining_r, eq-1)

        sum_b = b * w_u

        remaining_r -= b

        sum_c = prefix_sum[less + eq + remaining_r] - prefix_sum[less + eq]

        sum_elements += sum_a + sum_b + sum_c

        sum_choose = r * q*(q+1)//2 + (s - r) * q*(q-1)//2

        print(sum_elements + sum_choose)

    else:

        # compute sum_elements as per steps 7a-7f

        a = min(less, m)

        sum_a = prefix_sum[a]

        remaining_m = m - a

        b = min(remaining_m, eq-1)

        sum_b = b * w_u

        remaining_m -= b

        sum_c = prefix_sum[less + eq + remaining_m] - prefix_sum[less + eq]

        sum_elements = sum_a + sum_b + sum_c

        print(sum_elements)

But this requires precomputing the global sorted list and its prefix sums, and for each u, compute less, eq, and other values.

This approach is feasible and efficient.

Now, to implement this correctly:

1. Sort the global list.

2. Compute prefix sums.

3. Precompute for each weight, the count of elements less than and equal to it.

But how to compute less and eq for each u's weight:

- Using binary search on the sorted list.

For each u's w_u:

- less = bisect_left(sorted_global, w_u)

- eq = bisect_right(sorted_global, w_u) - less

This gives the number of elements less than w_u and equal to w_u.

Thus, the code can be written as follows.

But due to time constraints, here's the corrected code.
