To solve this problem, we need to turn off all the lights in an n x n matrix using row, column, and individual cell operations. The individual cell operations are limited to k times. The goal is to achieve this within 3n operations.

### Approach
1. **Row Flips**: First, we flip each row if its first element is 1. This ensures that the first column of the matrix becomes all 0s.
2. **Column Flips**: Next, we flip each column (starting from the second column) if the first element of that column in the first row is 1. This ensures that the first row becomes all 0s.
3. **Check Remaining 1s**: After the above steps, the remaining 1s will be confined to the submatrix starting from the second row and second column. We count these remaining 1s.
4. **Individual Flips**: If the number of remaining 1s (m) is less than or equal to k, we use individual cell operations to turn them off. If m exceeds k, it's impossible to turn off all lights within the given constraints.

### Solution Code
```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
matrix = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
operations = []

# Step 1: Flip rows to make the first column all 0s
for i in range(n):
    if matrix[i][0] == 1:
        # Flip the entire row
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[i][j] ^= 1
        operations.append((i + 1, 0))

# Step 2: Flip columns (from 2nd to nth) to make the first row all 0s (except first column)
for j in range(1, n):
    if matrix[0][j] == 1:
        # Flip the entire column
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i][j] ^= 1
        operations.append((0, j + 1))

# Check the remaining 1s in the submatrix (rows 2..n, columns 2..n)
remaining = []
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(1, n):
        if matrix[i][j] == 1:
            remaining.append((i + 1, j + 1))  # Convert to 1-based indices

m = len(remaining)
if m > k:
    print(-1)
else:
    operations.extend(remaining)
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        x, y = op
        if y == 0:
            print(x, 0)
        elif x == 0:
            print(0, y)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

### Explanation
1. **Row Flips**: By flipping rows where the first element is 1, we ensure the first column becomes all 0s. This step takes O(n) time for each row, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity.
2. **Column Flips**: By flipping columns where the first element (after row flips) is 1, we ensure the first row becomes all 0s. This step also takes O(n^2) time.
3. **Check Remaining 1s**: We count the 1s in the submatrix starting from the second row and column. This step takes O(n^2) time.
4. **Individual Flips**: If the remaining 1s are within the allowed limit (k), we use individual operations to turn them off. This step ensures we meet the constraint of using at most 3n operations.

This approach efficiently reduces the problem to a manageable submatrix and ensures the solution meets the given constraints.
