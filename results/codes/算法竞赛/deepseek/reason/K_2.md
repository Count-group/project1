Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem statement is a bit complex. We need to compute the sum of the maximum matching counts for all possible non-empty subsets of points on an n x m grid. Each subset forms a graph where two points are connected if they share the same row or column. The maximum matching here refers to the largest set of edges with no shared vertices.

Hmm. The first thing I need to understand is how the maximum matching is determined in such a graph. Since the edges are between points in the same row or column, the graph is a bipartite graph, right? Because rows and columns can form two partitions. Wait, no. Actually, each point is a node, and edges are between nodes in the same row or column. So the graph isn't bipartite in the traditional sense. But the maximum matching in this case would depend on the structure of the rows and columns in the subset.

Wait, but for a bipartite graph, the maximum matching can be found using algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp. But since we have to consider all subsets, enumerating them all is impossible. So we need a combinatorial approach here.

Let me think. For any subset of points, the graph is formed by edges between points in the same row or same column. The maximum matching in such a graph would be the maximum number of edges we can select such that no two edges share a vertex. Since each edge is either a row edge or a column edge.

But wait, the maximum matching here is equivalent to the maximum set of edges where each edge is either in a row or a column, and no two edges share a vertex. So this is similar to a graph where each edge is part of a row or column, and we need the largest possible matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by considering each row and column separately. For a given subset of points in a row, the maximum number of edges (which are pairs of points in that row) is floor(k/2), where k is the number of points in the row. Similarly for each column. But when combining rows and columns, how do these interact?

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum matching is the maximum number of edges with no common vertices. So each edge is a pair of points in the same row or column. The maximum matching is the largest possible set of such edges that don't share any points. So, in other words, it's a matching in the graph where edges are between any two points in the same row or same column.

Now, the maximum matching in such a graph can be found using the following approach: the maximum matching is the minimum between the size of the vertex cover and the maximum possible edges, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum matching can be determined by considering the rows and columns. Each row contributes some number of edges (like floor(k_i/2) for k_i points in row i), and each column contributes floor(l_j/2) for l_j points in column j. But these can't be simply summed because the edges from rows and columns might share vertices. So the actual maximum matching is not just the sum of the row-wise and column-wise maxima. So that approach is incorrect.

Hmm. Then how do we model the maximum matching for a given subset of points?

Another angle: Each edge in the matching uses two points, and each point can be in at most one edge. So the maximum matching is the maximum possible size of a set of edges (each edge is a pair from the same row or column) such that no two edges share a point.

This is exactly the maximum matching problem for the graph formed by the edges as defined. But for a general graph, finding the maximum matching is non-trivial. However, given the structure of the graph (edges exist between points in the same row or column), perhaps there's a pattern here.

Wait, the graph is a union of cliques for each row and each column. Each row is a clique (every two points in the same row are connected), and each column is a clique (every two points in the same column are connected). So the graph is a union of row cliques and column cliques.

The maximum matching in such a graph would be the maximum possible edges selected such that no two edges are adjacent. Since each edge is part of a row or a column clique.

Alternatively, the maximum matching can be found by considering the bipartition between rows and columns, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching can be represented as the sum of the maximum matchings from the rows and columns, but with some overlap subtracted. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum matching is the maximum between the sum of the row contributions (each row's floor(k_i/2)) and the sum of the column contributions (each column's floor(l_j/2)), but that's also not correct because some edges in rows and columns can be combined in a way that uses different points.

Wait, for example, suppose a subset has points (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Then in row 1, there are two points, so floor(2/2) = 1 edge. In column 1, there are two points, floor(2/2) =1 edge. But the maximum matching here is 1, because if we take the row edge (1,1)-(1,2), then the column edge (1,1)-(2,1) can't be taken. Similarly, if we take the column edge, the row edge can't be taken. So the maximum is 1, not 2. So the sum of row and column contributions is 2, but the actual maximum is 1. So this suggests that simply adding the row and column contributions overcounts.

Therefore, the maximum matching is not simply the sum of row and column contributions. So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm. So how do we model this? It's tricky.

Alternative idea: The problem asks for the sum over all subsets of the maximum matching. Let's denote S as the sum we need to compute.

The maximum matching for a subset is the maximum possible number of edges in a matching. So for each subset, we compute this maximum and add it to S.

The challenge is to compute S efficiently, given that the number of subsets is 2^(n*m) - 1, which is way too big to compute directly.

We need a way to model the contribution of each possible edge to the sum S, but in a way that accounts for the maximum matching structure.

Let's think about inclusion-exclusion or generating functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching can be broken down into parts that can be computed combinatorially.

Let me think of the problem in terms of linearity of expectation. Suppose that for each possible edge in a matching, we compute the number of subsets where this edge is part of the maximum matching. Then summing over all edges would give us the total sum S. But I'm not sure if this works because the maximum matching is dynamic based on the subset.

Wait, but maximum matching is a structure, and each edge's presence in the maximum matching depends on the subset and the other edges. So perhaps that approach isn't feasible.

Alternative approach: For each subset, the maximum matching is the maximum possible size of a set of edges (each from a row or column) with no overlapping vertices. Let's model this as the maximum possible for the subset.

But how to compute the sum over all subsets?

Another idea: The maximum matching for a subset is equal to the minimum between the number of edges in a maximum matching of the row edges and the column edges. Wait, no. That doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching can be determined by the maximum of two values: the sum of the row contributions (summing floor(k_i/2) for each row i with k_i points) and the sum of the column contributions (summing floor(l_j/2) for each column j with l_j points). But again, as before, this isn't correct because overlapping edges from rows and columns can't be taken.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum matching is the maximum between the sum of row contributions and the sum of column contributions. For example, in a subset where rows have more edges possible, we take all row edges, and vice versa.

In the previous example with points (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), the row contribution is 1, column contribution is 1, but the maximum matching is 1. So the maximum of row and column sums is 1, which is correct. But what if there's a case where row and column contributions can be combined?

Wait, consider a subset with four points forming a 2x2 grid. So each row has two points (contributing 1 each) and each column has two points (contributing 1 each). The sum of row contributions is 2, the sum of column contributions is 2. But the maximum matching here is 2: we can take two edges, like two row edges (each from a different row) or two column edges (each from a different column). So in this case, the maximum is 2, which is the sum of row contributions. So the maximum of row and column sums would also be 2, which is correct.

Another example: a subset with three points in a row (row 1 has three points, contributing 1 (floor(3/2)=1) and no points in columns. So the sum of row contributions is 1, columns 0. Maximum matching is 1.

Another example: two points in a row and two in a column, forming a cross. For example, (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1). The row contribution is 1 (from row 1), column contribution is 1 (from column 1). But the maximum matching can be 2: pick the row edge (1,1)-(1,2), and the column edge (2,1)-(3,1). These two edges don't share any vertices. So the maximum is 2, which is higher than either row or column sums. So this breaks the previous idea.

Hmm. So this suggests that the maximum matching can be larger than the sum of row and column contributions. So this approach is incorrect.

So the initial idea of taking the maximum between the sum of row contributions and sum of column contributions is wrong. So how do we model this?

Alternative approach: The maximum matching is equal to the size of the maximum bipartite matching in a bipartite graph where one partition is the rows and columns, and the other is the points. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph between the points and their possible edges. But this seems unclear.

Alternatively, think of the problem as a line graph where each edge in the original graph (which is a row or column edge) is a node, and edges connect if they share a vertex. The maximum matching would then be a maximum independent set in this line graph, but that's not helpful.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a mathematical way to model this.

Another idea: For any subset of points, the maximum matching is equal to the maximum between:

a) the sum over rows of floor(k_i / 2), plus the sum over columns of floor(l_j / 2) minus the minimum between the row sum and column sum. 

Wait, perhaps not. But I'm trying to find a way to account for the overlap between row and column edges.

Alternatively, the maximum matching is the sum of floor(k_i/2) for rows plus floor(l_j/2) for columns, minus the overlap where both row and column edges are used, leading to some overlap. But this is vague.

Alternatively, the problem is similar to the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where the two partitions are the rows and columns, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the original graph can be transformed into a bipartite graph where one partition is the rows and columns, and the other is the points. But that's not standard.

Alternatively, the maximum matching can be viewed as the maximum number of edges that can be selected such that no two edges share a point. This is exactly the maximum matching definition. So for the graph where edges are between points in the same row or column, find the maximum matching.

But how to compute this for all subsets?

Perhaps, for each subset, the maximum matching is equal to the maximum possible size of a matching that uses edges from rows and columns, but ensuring no two edges share a point.

But how to model this combinatorially?

Another angle: For each subset of points, the maximum matching is the maximum number of edges that can be selected, each from a row or a column, with no overlapping points. Let's denote this as M.

Each edge in a row uses two points from that row, and each edge in a column uses two points from that column. So to maximize M, we need to select as many edges as possible from the rows and columns, ensuring that no two edges share a point.

This is equivalent to a vertex-disjoint set of edges. So the problem is to select edges from the row cliques and column cliques such that no two edges are adjacent (i.e., share a vertex).

This is the same as finding a maximum matching in the graph formed by the edges of the rows and columns.

But for a general graph, this is hard. However, given the structure of the graph (which is a union of cliques for each row and column), perhaps there's a pattern.

Let me think. For any subset of points, the graph is a union of cliques (each row's clique and each column's clique). The maximum matching in a graph that's a union of cliques may have certain properties.

Wait, but each point can be part of a row clique and a column clique. So if a point is in both a row and a column, it can be part of edges from either.

Hmm. Another idea: The maximum matching for such a graph is the maximum between the sum of the row-based matchings and the sum of the column-based matchings. Because if you choose to take all possible row edges, then you can't take any column edges that share those points. Similarly for columns. So perhaps the maximum is the maximum between the two sums.

But this was contradicted by the earlier example where the maximum could be higher than both sums. So that idea is wrong.

Wait, in the earlier example where two edges can be taken from row and column, the sum of row contributions was 1, column contributions 1, but the maximum was 2. So this suggests that the maximum can be the sum of row and column contributions, but that's only possible when the edges from rows and columns are completely disjoint.

So the maximum matching is at least the maximum of the row sum and column sum, and possibly higher if there's a way to combine row and column edges without overlapping.

But how to model this for all possible subsets?

This seems really challenging. Perhaps we need to find a way to compute the sum over all subsets by considering the contribution of each possible pair of points (as edges) and how often they are part of the maximum matching.

Alternatively, let's consider the problem's sample input. For example, when n=1 and m=2, the grid has two points. There's only one row, and two columns. The possible non-empty subsets are all subsets except the empty set. Let's see:

- Subsets with one point: no edges. So maximum matching is 0.

- Subset with both points: there's one edge (row edge). So maximum matching is 1.

There are 2^2 -1 =3 subsets. But only the subset with both points contributes 1. So the sum is 1. Which matches the sample input where the output is 1 for 1 2.

So the sum is 1 in that case.

Another sample input is 2x2 grid. The sample output is 10. Let's see why.

The total number of non-empty subsets is 2^4 -1=15. For each subset, compute the maximum matching.

But calculating this manually is time-consuming. But perhaps there's a pattern here.

But the approach in the previous code that was written by the assistant (the code that was provided) seems to compute sumR and sumC as the contributions from rows and columns, and then subtract sumMin. But the code was incorrect. So perhaps the correct approach is that the maximum matching for a subset is the maximum between the sum of row contributions and the sum of column contributions, plus the minimum between the two. Or perhaps it's the sum of the maximum of row and column contributions for each row and column, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching for a subset can be expressed as the sum over all rows of floor(k_i/2) plus the sum over all columns of floor(l_j/2), but this counts some overlaps where edges from rows and columns share points, so this sum is an upper bound. The actual maximum is this upper bound minus the overlaps. But how?

This is getting stuck. Let's think of the problem differently.

The problem requires summing the maximum matching for every non-empty subset. This sum can be broken down into contributions from each possible edge. For each edge, how many subsets exist where that edge is part of the maximum matching for the subset. Summing over all edges would give the total sum. However, this approach is complicated because an edge's inclusion in the maximum matching depends on the presence of other edges and points in the subset.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching for a subset can be expressed as the sum of the maximum possible edges that can be selected from each row and column, minus the overlapping edges. But again, this is vague.

Let's look for hints in the problem's mathematical structure. The sum over all subsets can often be expressed as a product of terms involving each element's contribution. For example, for each element, we can compute the probability that it's included in some structure and multiply accordingly.

But here, the maximum matching is a global property of the subset. So this approach may not be directly applicable.

Another idea: Since each edge in the graph is part of a row or column clique, perhaps the maximum matching is a combination of edges from rows and columns that do not share any points. This is equivalent to finding a set of edges from rows and columns such that no two edges are adjacent (i.e., share a point). The maximum size of such a set is the maximum matching.

This is equivalent to finding the maximum set of edges such that each edge is from a row or column, and no two edges share a point.

Now, this sounds like a matching in the line graph of the original graph. The line graph's nodes are edges of the original graph, and edges in the line graph connect edges that share a vertex. So a matching in the line graph is a set of edges (original edges) with no two sharing a vertex. Thus, the maximum matching in the original graph is the size of the maximum matching in the line graph.

But this doesn't directly help us compute the sum over all subsets.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem in terms of generating functions. For each row and column, we can model the possible ways to choose edges and combine them without overlapping.

But this seems complex. Let's consider the problem when there's only one row. For example, n=1, m=anything. In this case, all points are in the same row. For a subset of k points, the maximum matching is floor(k/2). So the sum over all subsets is the sum over k=1 to m of (number of subsets with k points) * floor(k/2).

Similarly, if there's only one column, the same logic applies.

But for multiple rows and columns, the problem is to combine the contributions from each row and column, ensuring that edges don't overlap.

But this seems intractable for large n and m. So perhaps there's a combinatorial formula that can be derived.

Let's consider the case where the maximum matching is simply the sum of the row contributions. That is, we take as many edges as possible from the rows, and none from the columns. For each subset, the sum of floor(k_i/2) for each row i. Similarly for columns. Then the maximum of these two sums is the maximum matching. But as we saw earlier, this is not always the case.

But if we can compute the sum of the maximum between the row sum and column sum for all subsets, that would give the correct answer. However, this still seems challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum matching can be written as the sum of the row contributions plus the column contributions minus the sum of the minimum of the row and column contributions for each point. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion principle comes into mind. The maximum of two values can be expressed as their sum minus their minimum. So, max(a, b) = a + b - min(a, b). So, if the maximum matching is the maximum between the sum of row contributions and the sum of column contributions, then:

sum_max_matching = sum_over_subsets [ max(row_contrib, column_contrib) ] 
= sum_over_subsets [ row_contrib + column_contrib - min(row_contrib, column_contrib) ]

So, this breaks the problem into three parts: summing the row contributions, summing the column contributions, and subtracting the sum of the minimum of the two for each subset.

If this is the case, then the solution can be computed as:

sumR = sum over all subsets of row_contrib
sumC = sum over all subsets of column_contrib
sumMin = sum over all subsets of min(row_contrib, column_contrib)
result = (sumR + sumC - sumMin) mod 998244353

Now, the question is how to compute sumR, sumC, and sumMin efficiently.

Let's start with sumR. For each subset, the row contribution is the sum over each row of floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the number of points in row i of the subset.

sumR = sum_{S subset non-empty} sum_{i=1 to n} floor(k_i/2)

But this can be rewritten as:

sumR = sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{S non-empty} floor(k_i(S)/2) * [other points can be any]

Because for each row i, the contribution to sumR is floor(k_i/2) multiplied by the number of subsets where row i has k_i points, and the other rows and columns can have any combination of points (but such that the subset is non-empty).

But wait, for each row i, the contribution of floor(k_i/2) is multiplied by the number of subsets where row i has exactly k_i points, and the other points (in other rows) can be any combination. However, the other points in the same row are fixed to exactly k_i, and the other rows can vary.

But the other rows can vary in their own points, but the subset must be non-empty. So we can split this into:

For row i, the contribution to sumR is the sum over k_i (0 < k_i <= m) of floor(k_i/2) * C(m, k_i) * (2^{m*(n-1)} ) * (2^{m*(n-1)} - 1) if other rows are allowed to be anything except when all other rows are empty and row i is also empty. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, for each row i, the contribution to sumR is:

sum_{k_i=0 to m} floor(k_i/2) * C(m, k_i) * (2^{ (m*(n-1)) } ) - (the case where the subset is empty).

But the total subsets where row i has exactly k_i points is C(m, k_i) * 2^{m*(n-1)}, because for each of the other n-1 rows, each of their m points can be present or not. But this includes the case where all other points are zero and row i's k_i is zero, which is the empty subset. But since we're considering non-empty subsets, we need to subtract that case.

So the correct sum for row i's contribution is:

sum_{k_i=0}^m floor(k_i/2) * C(m, k_i) * (2^{m*(n-1)} - 1) if k_i >= 1 and the other rows are all empty. Or wait, no.

Wait, the total number of subsets where row i has exactly k_i points (k_i can be 0) and the other rows have any combination is C(m, k_i) * 2^{m*(n-1)}. But we need to exclude the empty subset, which occurs when all rows (including i) are empty. So the total number of non-empty subsets where row i has exactly k_i points is:

if k_i >=1: C(m, k_i) * 2^{m*(n-1)} 

plus if k_i=0: (0) because the other rows can be any, but the subset must be non-empty. So the sum for row i's contribution is:

sum_{k_i=1}^m floor(k_i/2) * C(m, k_i) * 2^{m*(n-1)} 

But for each row i, the other rows' points are irrelevant to the row i's contribution. So the sum over all non-empty subsets of the row contribution for row i is:

sum_{k_i=1}^m floor(k_i/2) * C(m, k_i) * (2^{m*(n-1)} ) 

But then, sumR is the sum of these values for all rows i from 1 to n.

But this seems manageable. Let's compute this.

Similarly for sumC.

Now, the sum for sumR can be computed for each row as follows:

For a single row, the contribution is sum_{k=1}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k) * 2^{m*(n-1)} }.

But since there are n rows, sumR = n * [sum_{k=1}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k) ] * 2^{m*(n-1)} }

But wait, no. For each row i, the term is sum_{k_i=1}^m floor(k_i/2) * C(m, k_i) * 2^{m*(n-1)} }, because the other rows can have any combination (but the subset is non-empty as long as the row i has k_i >=1, but if the other rows are all empty, then the subset is non-empty because row i has at least one point). So yes, the sum over k_i=1 to m of floor(k_i/2) * C(m, k_i) multiplied by 2^{m*(n-1)} }, and multiplied by n rows.

So sumR = n * S_row * 2^{m*(n-1)} }, where S_row is sum_{k=1}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k).

Similarly, sumC = m * S_col * 2^{n*(m-1)} }, where S_col is sum_{k=1}^n floor(k/2) * C(n, k).

Wait, no. Because for sumC, each column j contributes sum_{k=1}^n floor(k/2) * C(n, k) * 2^{n*(m-1)} }, and there are m columns.

Yes.

So sumR and sumC can be computed as:

sumR = n * (sum_{k=1}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k) ) * (2^{m*(n-1)} )

sumC = m * (sum_{k=1}^n floor(k/2) * C(n, k) ) * (2^{n*(m-1)} )

But wait, what is sum_{k=1}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k)?

Let's compute that. For example, when m=2, sum_{k=1}^2 floor(k/2)*C(2,k) = floor(1/2)*C(2,1) + floor(2/2)*C(2,2) = 0*2 + 1*1 = 1.

Which matches the sample input where n=1 and m=2: sumR = 1 * 1 * 2^{2*(1-1)} = 1*1*1 =1. And sumC = 2 * sum_{k=1}^1 ... but m=2 columns, sum for each column is sum_{k=1}^1 floor(k/2)*C(1,k) when n=1 (columns have 1 point each). So sumC for m=2 would be 2 * sum_{k=1}^1 floor(k/2)*C(1,k) * 2^{1*(2-1)} = 2*(0*1) * 2^1 =0. So sumR+sumC - sumMin =1+0 - sumMin. But sample input 1 2 has sumMin=0, so result is 1.

Which matches the sample.

So this approach seems promising.

Now, the key is to compute S_row and S_col.

Let's compute S_row for general m.

sum_{k=1}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k) 

= sum_{k=1}^m (k//2) * C(m, k)

= sum_{s=0}^{floor((m-1)/2)} (s) * C(m, 2s+1) + sum_{s=1}^{floor(m/2)} s * C(m, 2s) }

But this might not be the best way.

Alternatively, note that for even k=2s, floor(k/2)=s, and for odd k=2s+1, floor(k/2)=s.

So the sum can be rewritten as:

sum_{s=0}^{floor((m-1)/2)} s * C(m, 2s+1) + sum_{s=1}^{floor(m/2)} s * C(m, 2s) 

But combining these terms:

sum_{s=0}^{max} s [C(m,2s+1) + C(m, 2s)] ] ?

Hmm. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form expression for this sum.

Let's consider generating functions.

Let's compute S = sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k)

Then, sum_{k=1}^m ... is S - 0*C(m,0) = S.

Because when k=0, floor(0/2)=0.

So S = sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) * C(m, k).

We need to compute this sum.

We can split the sum into even and odd terms.

For even k=2s:

sum_{s=0}^{floor(m/2)} s * C(m, 2s)

For odd k=2s+1:

sum_{s=0}^{floor((m-1)/2)} s * C(m, 2s+1)

So S = sum_even + sum_odd.

Let's compute these two sums.

For even terms:

sum_even = sum_{s=0}^{floor(m/2)} s * C(m, 2s)

For odd terms:

sum_odd = sum_{s=0}^{floor((m-1)/2)} s * C(m, 2s+1)

Now, how to compute these sums.

Let's consider generating functions. The generating function for the sum over even k is:

sum_even = sum_{s=0}^\infty s * C(m,2s) 

Similarly for sum_odd.

But perhaps there's a combinatorial identity that can help.

Alternatively, note that:

sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k) x^k = (1 + x)^m.

We can differentiate this to find expressions involving k.

But perhaps consider generating functions where we separate even and odd terms.

The sum over even k: sum_{k even} C(m,k) x^k = [(1 + x)^m + (1 - x)^m]/2.

Similarly, sum over odd k: [(1+x)^m - (1 -x)^m]/2.

But how to incorporate the s factor.

Let's think of sum_even = sum_{s} s * C(m,2s).

Let s = k/2 where k is even.

But perhaps we can find the generating function for sum_even.

Let's consider generating function F(x) = sum_{s=0}^{m} s * C(m,2s) x^s.

But this may not be straightforward.

Alternatively, consider that sum_even is the sum over even k of (k/2) * C(m, k).

So sum_even = sum_{k even} (k/2) * C(m, k) = (1/2) sum_{k even} k C(m, k).

Similarly, sum_odd = sum_{k odd} floor(k/2) * C(m, k) = sum_{k odd} ((k-1)/2) C(m, k) = (1/2) sum_{k odd} (k-1) C(m,k).

But (k-1) = k - 1, so sum_odd = (1/2) [ sum_{k odd} k C(m,k) - sum_{k odd} C(m,k) ].

So sum_even + sum_odd = (1/2) sum_{k even} k C(m,k) + (1/2) [ sum_{k odd} k C(m,k) - sum_{k odd} C(m,k) ]

= (1/2) sum_{k=0}^m k C(m,k) - (1/2) sum_{k odd} C(m,k) 

The sum_{k=0}^m k C(m,k) = m 2^{m-1}.

The sum_{k odd} C(m,k) = 2^{m-1}.

So sum_even + sum_odd = (1/2) * m 2^{m-1} - (1/2) * 2^{m-1} 

= (m 2^{m-1} - 2^{m-1}) / 2 

= 2^{m-2} (m -1)

So S = sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) C(m,k) = 2^{m-2} (m-1).

Wait, is this correct?

Let's test for m=2:

sum_{k=0}^2 floor(k/2) C(2, k) 

k=0: 0 *1=0

k=1: 0*2=0

k=2:1*1=1

Sum is 1. 2^{2-2} (2-1) = 1*1=1. Correct.

For m=3:

sum is:

k=0: 0

k=1:0 *3=0

k=2:1 *3=3

k=3:1 *1=1

Total sum is 4. 

According to the formula, 2^{3-2} (3-1) = 2^1 *2 =4. Correct.

For m=4:

sum:

k=0:0

k=1:0*4=0

k=2:1*6=6

k=3:1*4=4

k=4:2*1=2

Sum: 6+4+2=12.

Formula: 2^{4-2} (4-1) =4*3=12. Correct.

Yes! So the formula S = sum_{k=0}^m floor(k/2) C(m,k) = (m-1) * 2^{m-2}.

Wow, that's a great insight. This simplifies the computation of sumR and sumC significantly.

So S_row = sum_{k=1}^m floor(k/2) C(m,k) = (m-1) * 2^{m-2}

Similarly for S_col = sum_{k=1}^n floor(k/2) C(n,k) = (n-1) * 2^{n-2}

But wait, when m=1, S_row would be sum_{k=1}^1 floor(1/2)*C(1,1) =0 *1=0. According to the formula, (1-1)*2^{-1+2} =0*2^1=0, which is correct.

So yes, the formula holds.

So sumR = n * (m-1) * 2^{m-2} * 2^{m*(n-1)} }

= n * (m-1) * 2^{m-2 + m(n-1)} }

= n * (m-1) * 2^{m(n-1) + m -2 } 

= n * (m-1) * 2^{m(n) -2 }

Wait, m(n-1) + m = m(n-1+1) = m n. So m(n-1) +m -2 = mn -2.

Yes. So sumR = n*(m-1)*2^{mn -2}.

Similarly, sumC = m*(n-1)*2^{mn -2}.

Then sumR + sumC = (n(m-1) + m(n-1)) ) * 2^{mn-2} 

= (2mn -n -m) * 2^{mn-2} 

But according to the inclusion-exclusion formula, the sum_max_matching = sumR + sumC - sumMin.

So the problem reduces to computing sumMin, which is the sum over all non-empty subsets of the minimum between the row contribution and column contribution.

But computing sumMin is challenging. How can this be done efficiently?

The sumMin is sum_{S} min( sum_{rows} floor(k_i/2), sum_{columns} floor(l_j/2) )

This seems like a difficult combinatorial problem. However, given the time constraints for programming competition, there must be a clever way to compute this.

But how?

Wait, perhaps for a subset S, the row contribution is R = sum_{i} floor(k_i/2), column contribution C = sum_{j} floor(l_j/2). Then min(R,C) = sum_{t=1}^\infty [if R >=t and C >=t then 1 else 0]. So sumMin = sum_{t=1}^\infty sum_{S} [ R >=t and C >=t ].

But this doesn't immediately help.

Another idea: For a given subset S, the row contribution R and column contribution C are both integers. The minimum of R and C is the sum over t from 1 to min(R,C) of 1.

But summing this over all subsets S is equivalent to summing over all t >=1 the number of subsets where R >=t and C >=t.

So sumMin = sum_{t=1}^\infty (number of subsets S where R(S) >=t and C(S) >=t)

But this is still not easy to compute.

Alternatively, since R and C are sums over rows and columns of their individual contributions, perhaps generating functions can be used to model the distribution of R and C.

But with n and m up to 500, it's challenging to compute this directly.

Wait, but the row contributions and column contributions are additive. For each row i, the contribution is floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the number of points selected in that row. Similarly for columns.

So R = sum_{i=1}^n floor(k_i/2), and C = sum_{j=1}^m floor(l_j/2), where l_j is the number of points selected in column j.

But the variables k_i and l_j are related. For example, l_j is the sum over all i of the indicator that (i,j) is in the subset.

But this seems complicated. However, note that the choice of subset is equivalent to choosing a binary matrix of size n x m, where each cell is 0 or 1 (presence in the subset). The sum R is the sum over rows of floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the sum of the row's entries. The sum C is similarly for columns.

The sumMin is the sum over all non-empty binary matrices of min(R, C).

This is a two-dimensional problem. To compute this sum, perhaps we can model it using dynamic programming, considering each row and column's contribution and keeping track of the sum of R and C.

But with n and m up to 500, this seems impossible with standard DP techniques.

Alternative idea: Since each row's contribution floor(k_i/2) is independent of other rows, and each column's contribution is similarly independent, perhaps the generating functions for the row contributions and column contributions can be multiplied, and then the sumMin can be computed using some convolution.

But again, the dependencies between rows and columns make this challenging.

Another approach: For each cell (i,j), the presence or absence in the subset can be modeled as a variable. But the contributions R and C are additive across rows and columns, respectively.

But even this seems difficult.

Perhaps there's a mathematical identity that allows sumMin to be expressed in terms of sumR, sumC, and some other terms. But I'm not aware of such an identity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by noting that the row contributions and column contributions are both linear in the number of points chosen in each row and column. But the minimum function is non-linear, making it difficult.

Given that sumR and sumC can be computed efficiently, but sumMin is the major challenge, perhaps there's a pattern or a precomputed formula for sumMin based on the values of n and m.

But I'm not seeing it. 

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach for the problem is to compute sumR and sumC using the derived formulas and subtract sumMin, but find a way to compute sumMin using generating functions and dynamic programming.

For example, consider that each row contributes a certain amount to R, and each column contributes to C. We can model the possible values of R and C using generating functions, then compute the sum of the minimum of R and C across all possible non-empty subsets.

Let's model the generating function for the rows. For each row i, the contribution to R is floor(k_i/2), where k_i is the number of points chosen in that row. The generating function for a single row's contribution would be:

For row i, the generating function is:

GR_i(x) = sum_{k_i=0}^m (x^{floor(k_i/2)} ) * C(m, k_i) * (product over other points not in this row)

But this seems unmanageable.

Alternatively, for all rows, the total contribution R is the sum of floor(k_i/2) for each row i. Similarly, C is the sum of floor(l_j/2) for each column j.

The sumMin is the sum over all subsets of min(R, C).

But to compute this, perhaps we can model the problem as a two-variable generating function, where each term is x^R y^C multiplied by the number of subsets that have R and C.

Then, the sumMin is the sum over all R and C of min(R, C) multiplied by the number of subsets with those R and C values.

But generating such a two-variable generating function for n and m up to 500 is computationally infeasible.

Alternative idea: Since R and C are both sums of individual contributions from rows and columns, perhaps R and C are independent. But they are not, because the choice of points affects both R and C.

For example, selecting a point in row i and column j increases k_i (row i's count) and l_j (column j's count), which affects both R and C.

Thus, R and C are dependent variables, and their joint distribution is needed. This makes the problem even more challenging.

Given the time constraints and the problem's complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute the sumR and sumC using the formulas derived, and then find a way to compute sumMin using dynamic programming with the inclusion-exclusion principle.

But how?

Let's consider that the sumMin is the sum over all subsets S of min(R(S), C(S)). Let's think of this as the sum over all possible values t where t <= R(S) and t <= C(S), and count how many subsets have R(S) >= t and C(S) >= t for each t. Then sum all these counts.

But even this approach is not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:

For each row i, when we select some points, it contributes a certain amount to R. For each column j, selecting some points contributes to C.

We need to model all possible R and C values and their combinations.

But again, this seems difficult.

Another idea: Let's consider that the sumMin can be expressed as:

sumMin = sum_{S} (R(S) + C(S) - max(R(S), C(S))) 

= sumR + sumC - sumMax.

Where sumMax is the sum over all subsets S of max(R(S), C(S)).

But according to earlier logic, sumMax is equal to sumR + sumC - sumMin. So this gives us sumMin = sumR + sumC - sumMax. But this doesn't directly help unless we can find sumMax.

But how to compute sumMax?

Hmm. It's the same problem as sumMin, but with max instead of min.

This suggests that the sumMin can be computed once sumR, sumC, and sumMax are known. But again, not helpful.

Given the time constraints and the fact that the problem requires handling large n and m (up to 500), it's clear that a O(n^3 m^3) approach is impossible. Hence, there must be a mathematical formula or a clever dynamic programming approach that can compute sumMin efficiently.

Another observation: The sumMin can be considered as the sum over all possible pairs of R and C, multiplied by min(R,C), multiplied by the number of subsets that have exactly R and C.

But this requires knowing the joint distribution of R and C, which is not obvious.

Let's think differently. For each cell (i,j), the contribution to sumMin depends on whether the subset includes that cell and how it affects R and C. But this is too vague.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to the case when n = 1 or m = 1. But given the sample input for n=1 and m=2, the sumMin is zero, and the result is sumR + sumC - sumMin = 1 + 0 -0 =1.

But for larger cases, like n=2, m=2, sumMin must be computed.

But how?

Another idea: For each subset, the row contribution R and column contribution C are both equal to the number of pairs in rows and columns, respectively. Then, the sumMin is the sum over all subsets of min(R, C).

But the sum over all subsets of min(R, C) can be found using the fact that min(a, b) = (a + b - |a -b|)/2.

So sumMin = sum_{S} (R + C - |R - C|)/2 

= (sumR + sumC - sum_{S} |R - C|)/2 

So, if we can compute sum_{S} |R - C|, then sumMin can be derived.

But again, computing sum_{S} |R - C| is challenging.

But perhaps there's a way to compute this using the generating functions of R and C.

But again, the problem is the dependency between R and C.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for patterns in the sample inputs.

For example, the sample input 2 2 has an output of 10.

sumR for n=2, m=2:

sumR = 2 * (2-1)*2^{2*2 -2} = 2*1*2^2=8

sumC = 2*(2-1)*2^{2*2 -2} =8.

sumR + sumC =16. So sumMin must be 16 -10 =6. Because sumR + sumC - sumMin =10. So sumMin=6.

But how is 6 derived? For n=2, m=2.

The total number of subsets is 15 (non-empty). Let's compute sumMin for each subset.

For each subset, compute R and C, then min(R,C).

For example:

- Subset with 1 point: R=0, C=0. min=0. But subset is non-empty. So contributes 0.

- Subset with 2 points in the same row: R=1, C=0. min=0.

- Subset with 2 points in the same column: R=0, C=1. min=0.

- Subset with 2 points in different rows and columns: R=0, C=0. min=0.

- Subset with 3 points: let's see. Suppose the points are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Then in row 1: 2 points → R=1. Row 2:1 → R=0. Total R=1. Column 1: 2 → C=1. Column 2:1 → C=0. So C=1. min(1,1)=1. So contributes 1.

There are multiple such subsets with three points, but the min(R,C) depends on the specific arrangement.

This manual calculation is time-consuming. But for 2x2, the sumMin is 6. How?

Possible subsets contributing to sumMin:

- All four points: R=2 (each row has two points, floor(2/2)=1 per row, sum 2. Columns also have two points each, sum 2. min(2,2)=2. Contributes 2.

- Subsets of three points in a way that R and C are both 1. For example, three points forming a 'L' shape. Then R=1 (two points in one row, one in another → floor(2/2)=1, floor(1/2)=0 → sum 1). Columns: two points in one column, one in another → sum 1. So min is 1. There are four such subsets (each L shape can be in a corner). Each contributes 1 → total 4.

- Subsets with four points: contributes 2.

So sum so far is 2 +4 =6. That accounts for the sumMin=6.

Thus, the sumMin=6 for n=2, m=2. Which aligns with the sample.

But how to compute this for general n and m.

This suggests that sumMin is the sum over all subsets where the row contribution and column contribution are both at least t, for all t.

But this approach is not tractable for large n and m.

An alternative approach is needed. Perhaps, given the complexity of sumMin, the problem requires a different insight.

Wait, in the code that the assistant initially wrote, they tried to compute sumMin using a dynamic programming approach. The code computes sumMin as follows:

- For each row, compute the generating function of the possible contributions (floor(k_i/2) for each possible k_i in the row.

- Multiply these generating functions to get the distribution of R.

- Do the same for columns to get the distribution of C.

- Then, for each possible R and C, compute the sum of min(R,C) multiplied by the number of subsets that have those R and C.

But even this approach may be computationally intensive.

But given that n and m are up to 500, and the maximum possible R and C are up to (n * floor(m/2)) and (m * floor(n/2)), which for 500 could be 250 *500 =125,000, this seems infeasible for large n and m.

However, the code seems to use a dynamic programming approach where for each row, the possible contributions are added to a DP array, considering the row's possible contributions. But this only tracks the sum of row contributions, not the column contributions. So this approach alone can't compute the sumMin.

This suggests that the initial code is incomplete and sumMin is not correctly computed.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach for this problem is to precompute sumR and sumC using the formulas derived, and then recognize that sumMin is zero for certain cases, but this is unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a symmetry where sumMin is equal to the sum of the products of the row and column contributions, but this is pure speculation.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should refer to the problem's sample inputs and see if there's a pattern.

For example, the sample input 4 4 gives an output of 241456. Let's compute sumR and sumC for n=4, m=4.

sumR =4 * (4-1)* 2^(4*4 -2) =4*3 * 2^14 = 12 * 16384 =196608.

sumC =4*(4-1)*2^(4*4-2) = same as sumR. So sumR + sumC= 196608 *2= 393216.

The sample output is 241456, so sumMin=393216 -241456 =151760.

But how this is derived remains unclear.

Another approach: Consider that for each subset, the row contribution R and column contribution C are each sums of independent variables. The sumMin is the sum over all subsets of the minimum of these two sums. This is equivalent to the sum of all possible pairs (r, c) where r <=c, multiplied by the number of subsets that have R=r and C=c, and vice versa.

But again, this is not helpful.

At this point, given the time constraints and the complexity of the problem, I must concede that I'm unable to derive the correct formula for sumMin and thus cannot provide a complete solution. However, based on the initial approach, the code should compute sumR and sumC correctly using the derived formulas, and then compute sumMin using an efficient dynamic programming approach. Unfortunately, without further insight into the sumMin calculation, the code will not pass all test cases.

The correct code likely involves generating functions for R and C and then combining them to compute the sum of min(R,C) for all subsets. However, this requires a sophisticated dynamic programming solution that tracks both R and C contributions, which is beyond the current understanding.
